<section>
  <p>Most professionals treat LinkedIn as background noise.</p>

  <p>A quick scroll between meetings. A glance during breaks.</p>

  <p>But repeated exposure shapes more than awareness — it shapes thinking.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How Repeated Content Exposure Influences Thinking</h2>

  <p>Human attention adapts to what it sees most often.</p>

  <p>Over time, feeds influence:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>what feels important,</li>
    <li>which topics seem urgent,</li>
    <li>how problems are framed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This happens gradually and unconsciously.</p>

  />
</figure>

<section>
  <h2>Why Engagement-Driven Feeds Shape Priorities</h2>

  <p>The LinkedIn feed promotes content that triggers reaction.</p>

  <p>This creates a bias toward:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>simplified opinions,</li>
    <li>trend-focused thinking,</li>
    <li>short-term relevance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Complex or nuanced topics receive less attention.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Subtle Effect on Workplace Decision Making</h2>

  <p>When certain narratives dominate the feed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>risk perception shifts,</li>
    <li>priorities compress,</li>
    <li>context is lost.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This affects how problems are approached at work.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Awareness Alone Is Not Enough</h2>

  <p>Knowing the feed influences thinking does not neutralize its effect.</p>

  <p>Exposure still matters.</p>

  <p>This limitation mirrors the challenge explained here:

</section>

<section>
