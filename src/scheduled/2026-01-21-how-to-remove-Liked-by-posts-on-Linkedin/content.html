        <p><em>Updated for 2026 — why you keep seeing “Liked by” posts on LinkedIn, what you can do about them, and how to finally clean your feed.</em></p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>If your LinkedIn feed feels messy, irrelevant, or just <em>full of posts from strangers</em>, you’re not imagining things.</p>
        <p>In 2026, LinkedIn still pushes “Liked by” and “Reacted by” posts aggressively — even if you never asked to see them.</p>
        <p>They clutter your feed. They show content from people you don’t follow. They make LinkedIn feel more like Facebook than a professional network.</p>
        <p>And here’s the truth:</p>
        <p><strong>LinkedIn doesn’t let you turn them off.</strong><br>
        Not in 2024.<br>
        Not in 2025.<br>
        And yes… still not in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
        <p>But don’t worry. You <em>can</em> reduce them — and you <em>can</em> remove them completely with the right setup.</p>
        <p>This guide shows exactly how.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why You’re Seeing “Liked by” Posts on LinkedIn (2026)</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn’s algorithm prioritizes <strong>engagement</strong>, not relevance. When someone in your network likes a post, LinkedIn assumes:</p>
        <blockquote>
          “If your friend liked it, maybe you will too.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>But this logic rarely works in real life.</p>
        <p>Some reasons LinkedIn keeps showing these posts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LinkedIn wants more engagement and more time spent on the platform.</li>
          <li>It helps boost viral content and reach.</li>
          <li>It fills your feed when you don’t follow many people.</li>
          <li>It pushes “popular” content even if it’s irrelevant to your career.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So the result?</p>
        <p>You open LinkedIn and see:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Posts about industries you don’t care about.</li>
          <li>Content from people you don’t know.</li>
          <li>Random motivational quotes.</li>
          <li>Viral nonsense.</li>
          <li>Endless “Liked by João”, “Reacted by Maria”, “Commented by Ana…”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It happens to <strong>everyone</strong>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Can You Disable “Liked by” Posts on LinkedIn?</h2>
        <p>Short answer: <strong>No — LinkedIn doesn’t offer a setting for this.</strong></p>
        <p>Not in the Feed Preferences. Not in the Privacy settings. Not in any hidden menu.</p>
        <p>You can <em>manually</em> hide posts one by one… but that doesn't fix the feed.</p>
        <p>You can unfollow people… but LinkedIn still shows liked posts from your extended network.</p>
        <p>So what can you actually do?</p>
        <p>There are three options.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Option 1 — Reduce “Liked by” Posts With Manual Settings</h2>
        <p>This helps a little, but won’t remove them completely.</p>
        <h3>1. Hide individual posts</h3>
        <p>Click the “…” on a post and select “I don't want to see this”.</p>

        <h3>2. Tell LinkedIn what you don’t like</h3>
        <p>Use the “Show less posts like this” option whenever available.</p>

        <h3>3. Unfollow people who only engage with low-quality content</h3>
        <p>Harsh… but effective in some cases.</p>

        <h3>4. Turn off some types of notifications</h3>
        <p>Reducing notification noise can slightly improve what appears in your feed.</p>

        <p>These steps take time. And LinkedIn usually brings the posts back later anyway.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Option 2 — Use an Ad Blocker (Why It Doesn’t Work)</h2>
        <p>Many users search for things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“linkedin adblock”</li>
          <li>“linkedin adblock chrome extension”</li>
          <li>“block ads on linkedin”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That makes sense: you want to clean up your feed, so you look for a LinkedIn ad blocker.</p>
        <p>But here’s the catch:</p>
        <p><strong>Ad blockers cannot remove “Liked by” posts.</strong><br>
        <strong>They also cannot remove suggested posts.</strong><br>
        <strong>They cannot truly clean your feed.</strong></p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>Because these posts are <strong>not ads</strong>. They’re part of the internal feed structure and rendered dynamically inside the LinkedIn app.</p>
        <p>So if you’ve tried using AdBlock, uBlock Origin, or other generic adblockers and nothing changed, that’s why.</p>
        <p>What you actually need is a <strong>feed filter</strong>, not just a “linkedin adblock” solution.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Option 3 — The Only Way to Remove “Liked by” Posts Completely (2026)</h2>
        <p>If your goal is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>remove “Liked by” posts,</li>
          <li>remove “Reacted by” posts,</li>
          <li>stop seeing posts from strangers,</li>
          <li>block suggested and recommended content,</li>
          <li>remove promoted posts and ads,</li>
          <li>have a clean professional feed again,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>… then manual settings won’t solve it. And ad blockers definitely won’t solve it.</p>
        <p>What you need is a <strong>feed filter</strong> that works at the LinkedIn feed level.</p>
        <p>This is where <strong>LinkTopics</strong> comes in.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How LinkTopics Removes “Liked by” Posts (Instantly)</h2>
        <p>LinkTopics is a Chrome extension built specifically to fix the LinkedIn feed.</p>
        <p>Here’s what it does:</p>
        <h3>Removes all “Liked by” posts</h3>
        <p>Not reduced. Not hidden one by one. <strong>Removed. Automatically.</strong></p>

        <h3>Removes “Reacted by” posts</h3>
        <p>So your feed stops showing content from complete strangers.</p>

        <h3>Removes Suggested Posts</h3>
        <p>All those “People are talking about…” posts disappear.</p>

        <h3>Removes Promoted Posts &amp; Ads</h3>
        <p>Including subtle LinkedIn promotional content that looks like normal posts.</p>

        <h3>Works in real time</h3>
        <p>As you scroll, the extension cleans the feed instantly.</p>

        <h3>You control what topics you want to see</h3>
        <p>If you want:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>only tech posts,</li>
          <li>only recruiting posts,</li>
          <li>only sales content,</li>
          <li>only startup and entrepreneurship content,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>LinkTopics keeps those and removes the rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Visual Example</strong><br>
        Before: chaotic feed, random posts, strangers everywhere.<br>
        After: clean, relevant, professional.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Why the Problem Exists (And Why It’s Worse in 2026)</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn’s feed changes constantly, but one thing hasn’t changed:</p>
        <p><strong>The algorithm always prioritizes engagement over relevance.</strong></p>
        <p>That means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>viral posts beat useful posts,</li>
          <li>likes matter more than context,</li>
          <li>emotional content spreads faster than professional content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In 2026, LinkedIn doubled down on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Suggested posts”,</li>
          <li>“People are talking about…”,</li>
          <li>“Liked by your connection”,</li>
          <li>posts from people you don’t follow,</li>
          <li>ads disguised as normal posts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For many users, this makes LinkedIn feel overwhelming.</p>
        <p>LinkTopics reverses this trend by giving <em>control back to you</em>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Manually Cleaning Your Feed Will Never Fully Work</h2>
        <p>Even if you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>unfollow people,</li>
          <li>hide posts,</li>
          <li>turn off notifications,</li>
          <li>adjust settings every week,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>LinkedIn <strong>keeps reintroducing</strong> the same content types.</p>
        <p>Why? Because they generate engagement. And engagement = revenue.</p>
        <p>That’s why tools like LinkTopics exist.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Clean Your LinkedIn Feed Today</h2>
        <p>Whether you use LinkTopics or not, here’s the best process:</p>

        <h3>Step 1 — Unfollow noisy connections</h3>
        <p>Not unfriending. Just unfollowing people who constantly engage with content you do not want to see.</p>

        <h3>Step 2 — Tell LinkedIn what you dislike</h3>
        <p>Use the “I don’t want to see this” and “Show less posts like this” options frequently.</p>

        <h3>Step 3 — Install LinkTopics (1 click)</h3>
        <p>This removes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>liked posts,</li>
          <li>reacted posts,</li>
          <li>promoted posts,</li>
          <li>suggested posts,</li>
          <li>many types of LinkedIn ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instantly.</p>

        <h3>Step 4 — Choose your preferred topics</h3>
        <p>Inside the extension, you can select:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sales,</li>
          <li>Marketing,</li>
          <li>Tech,</li>
          <li>AI,</li>
          <li>Recruiting,</li>
          <li>Startup,</li>
          <li>Leadership,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And your feed becomes personalized and useful again.</p>

        <h2>FAQ — Quick Answers</h2>

        <h3>Can I remove “Liked by” posts on LinkedIn?</h3>
        <p>Not using LinkedIn’s settings alone. LinkedIn does not provide any native option to disable those posts. To remove them from your feed, you need a feed filter like LinkTopics.</p>

        <h3>Why does LinkedIn show me posts from strangers?</h3>
        <p>Because someone in your network engaged with them. LinkedIn boosts those posts automatically, even if you do not follow the original author.</p>

        <h3>Does AdBlock remove LinkedIn ads?</h3>
        <p>No. Traditional ad blockers generally cannot remove LinkedIn ads or “Promoted” posts because they are rendered as part of the feed itself. A dedicated LinkedIn feed cleaner works better than a generic ‘linkedin adblock’ approach.</p>

        <h3>What is the best Chrome extension to remove LinkedIn clutter?</h3>
        <p>LinkTopics is built specifically to clean LinkedIn: it removes “Liked by” posts, “Reacted by” posts, suggested posts, and many forms of promoted content while keeping the topics you care about.</p>

        <h3>Can I fix my LinkedIn algorithm in 2026?</h3>
        <p>You can influence it by unfollowing noisy connections, hiding irrelevant posts and engaging with content you like. However, you cannot fully control it with settings alone. Tools like LinkTopics give you much stronger control over what appears in your feed.</p>
