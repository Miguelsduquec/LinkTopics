<section>
  <p>Recommended posts are one of the most confusing parts of the LinkedIn feed.</p>

  <p>They appear without a clear connection to people you follow, often interrupting otherwise relevant updates.</p>

  <p>For many users, this creates the feeling that the feed is being driven by something opaque and hard to influence.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How LinkedIn Decides What to Recommend</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn uses a mix of behavioral signals to generate recommendations.</p>

  <p>These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>posts similar to ones you’ve engaged with,</li>
    <li>topics popular within your broader network,</li>
    <li>content performing well across the platform.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The goal is engagement, not precision.</p>

  />

<section>
  <h2>Why Recommendations Often Miss the Mark</h2>

  <p>Recommendation systems work at scale.</p>

  <p>That means they rely on patterns, not context.</p>

  <p>As a result, recommended posts often:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>surface topics you explored once but no longer care about,</li>
    <li>favor viral content over useful updates,</li>
    <li>repeat similar ideas across multiple posts.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Cost of Constant Recommendations</h2>

  <p>Individually, a recommended post is easy to ignore.</p>

  <p>Over time, however, they change how the feed feels.</p>

  <p>Common effects include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>more scrolling to find relevant content,</li>
    <li>less trust in what appears organically,</li>
    <li>reduced sense of control.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is closely related to how feed consumption shapes professional focus:

<section>
  <h2>What LinkedIn Lets You Control</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn offers limited ways to influence recommendations.</p>

  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hide individual recommended posts,</li>
    <li>reduce engagement with irrelevant topics,</li>
    <li>unfollow sources that trigger repeated recommendations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn documents these controls here:
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a567336"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      LinkedIn Help — Hide and mute feed content
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>These actions help, but they don’t stop recommendations entirely.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Manual Control Isn’t Enough</h2>

  <p>Recommendations are continuously recalculated.</p>

  <p>Even if you hide several posts today, new recommendations appear tomorrow.</p>

  <p>This is the same limitation described in:

  <h2>How LinkTopics Helps Reduce Recommended Posts</h2>

  <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> filters recommended posts directly in the LinkedIn feed.</p>

  <p>This allows you to keep focus on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>people you actually follow,</li>
    <li>topics you care about now,</li>
    <li>original content over algorithmic suggestions.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Recommended posts are designed to keep you scrolling.</p>

  <p>They are not designed to reflect your priorities.</p>

  <p><strong>If you want a feed that stays relevant with less ongoing effort, reducing recommendation noise is essential.</strong></p>
