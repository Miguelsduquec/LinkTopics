<section>
  <p>If your LinkedIn feed feels like it’s mostly other people’s reactions, you’re seeing one of the platform’s strongest distribution mechanics.</p>

  <p>Instead of showing you only posts from people you follow, LinkedIn frequently shows posts because someone in your network liked them.</p>

  <p>In practice, that turns your feed into a reflection of your network’s engagement — not your priorities.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why “Liked by” Posts Are Everywhere</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn is built to maximize engagement. “Liked by” posts are a simple way to expand reach without relying only on followers.</p>

  <p>This format works because it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>uses social proof (someone you know reacted),</li>
    <li>surfaces content outside your usual circle,</li>
    <li>keeps the feed feeling “active” even when people you follow are quiet.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The downside is that relevance becomes harder to maintain — especially for daily users.</p>

<section>
  <h2>How “Network Activity” Hijacks Feed Quality</h2>

  <p>“Liked by” distribution rewards what your network reacts to most, not what helps you most.</p>

  <p>That creates predictable patterns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>viral posts repeat across your feed,</li>
    <li>low-effort content gets boosted through reactions,</li>
    <li>your feed becomes harder to steer with intent.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you’ve ever felt like you’re seeing the same type of content on loop, this is a big reason.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Hidden Cost: Time, Focus, and Missed Signal</h2>

  <p>Even when a “Liked by” post is harmless, it interrupts the purpose of your feed.</p>

  <p>For professionals using LinkedIn to learn, hire, or sell, the cost shows up as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>more scrolling to find relevant updates,</li>
    <li>less trust in what appears “naturally”,</li>
    <li>more distraction from your actual goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is closely related to the broader problem of engagement-driven ranking:

  <h2>What You Can Do Using LinkedIn’s Native Controls</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn doesn’t provide a single switch to turn off “Liked by” posts.</p>

  <p>But you can reduce their impact by combining several actions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hide</strong> specific posts that are clearly irrelevant,</li>
    <li><strong>Unfollow</strong> noisy connections without disconnecting,</li>
    <li><strong>Be intentional with engagement</strong> (likes and comments train what you see).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn documents feed controls like hiding and muting content here:

       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

    </a>
  </p>

  <p>These steps help, but they require constant attention to maintain.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Manual Cleanup Doesn’t Scale</h2>

  <p>“Liked by” posts are generated by ongoing activity across your network.</p>

  <p>So even if you hide one, another appears a few scrolls later.</p>

  <p>This is why manual cleanup usually breaks down over time, as explained in:
