<section>
  <p>LinkedIn was designed to connect professionals.</p>

  <p>Today, it competes aggressively for their attention.</p>

  <p>As noise increases, focus becomes a differentiator.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Attention Is Scarcer Than Opportunity</h2>

  <p>Most professionals have access to similar information.</p>

  <p>The difference lies in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>how much attention they can sustain,</li>
    <li>which signals they notice,</li>
    <li>what they choose to ignore.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Focus determines signal quality.</p>

<section>
  <h2>How LinkedIn Feed Design Fragments Attention</h2>

  <p>The feed encourages constant switching.</p>

  <p>This results in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>short attention cycles,</li>
    <li>reactive consumption,</li>
    <li>reduced depth of thought.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Fragmentation weakens professional judgment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Competitive Impact of Sustained Focus</h2>

  <p>Professionals who protect focus tend to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>spot trends earlier,</li>
    <li>make clearer decisions,</li>
    <li>act with better timing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These advantages compound over time.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Willpower Alone Is Not Enough</h2>

  <p>Focus is not just a discipline problem.</p>

  <p>It is an environment problem.</p>

  <p>This is similar to the limitation discussed here:
