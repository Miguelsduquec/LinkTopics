  <h1>Most People Scroll LinkedIn — But Very Few Use It Strategically</h1>
  <p>LinkedIn is full of opportunity — but passive scrolling prevents most users from ever benefiting from it.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Most People Don’t Get Results on LinkedIn</h2>
  <p>Millions log in daily expecting growth, learning or opportunities… yet interact with the platform passively.  
  LinkedIn doesn't reward passive behaviour. It rewards intention.</p>

  <p>If your feed feels chaotic, this article helps:  
    <a href="/blog/stay-focused-on-linkedin-with-linktopics">How to Stay Focused on LinkedIn</a>.
  </p>

  <p>This is also why searches like <em>“linkedin remove liked posts”</em> and <em>“linkedin algorithm fix”</em> keep increasing.</p>

<section>
  <h2>What Strategic LinkedIn Users Do Differently</h2>
  <p>Strategic users cultivate their environment instead of leaving it to chance.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>They follow selectively:</strong> only voices that add insight.</li>
    <li><strong>They engage with purpose:</strong> comments that build reputation.</li>
    <li><strong>They post intentionally:</strong> quality over volume.</li>
    <li><strong>They connect thoughtfully:</strong> meaningful relationships > random adds.</li>
    <li><strong>They curate their feed:</strong> removing noise that doesn’t match their goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Psychology research from  
    <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Psychology Today</a>  
    shows that reducing low-value inputs significantly increases clarity and cognitive performance.</p>

  <h2>Your Feed Determines Your Direction</h2>
  <p>Strategic thinking is impossible with a chaotic feed.  
  The quality of your inputs shapes the quality of your outcomes.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Strategy Outperforms Volume</h2>
  <p>Success on LinkedIn isn’t about posting every day, commenting everywhere or chasing visibility.  
  High-performers rely on a few consistent behaviours that compound.</p>

  <p>Intentional > constant.  
  Strategic > busy.  
  Quality > quantity.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>LinkedIn is not just a place to scroll — it’s a professional advantage.  
  You unlock that advantage when you use the platform intentionally, not passively.</p>
