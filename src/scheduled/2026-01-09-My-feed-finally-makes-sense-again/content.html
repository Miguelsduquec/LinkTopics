  <h1>“My Feed Finally Makes Sense Again.” — A Message I Got This Week</h1>
  <p>A clean, intentional LinkedIn feed can completely change how you learn, think, and work.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Why This Message Matters</h2>
  <p>Every week, users share how different LinkedIn feels once the noise disappears.  
  When someone says, <em>“My feed finally makes sense again,”</em> it reveals something deeper:  
  changing your digital environment changes your behaviour, focus, and results.</p>

  <p>According to research from  
    <a href="https://www.apa.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the American Psychological Association</a>,  
    reducing cognitive distractions significantly boosts clarity and decision-making.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Feed Shapes Your Focus</h2>
  <p>Most LinkedIn feeds are cluttered—“Liked by” posts, viral filler, random topics, ads, and recommendation noise.  
  All of this creates friction and reduces your ability to stay focused and learn effectively.</p>

  <p>If your feed feels overwhelming, you’re not alone. Many professionals search for ways to  
    <strong>clean their LinkedIn feed</strong>,  
    <strong>remove liked posts</strong>,  
    <strong>remove ads</strong>,  
    and fix the algorithm so they only see posts they actually care about.

  <h2>Social Proof Matters Because It Shows What Works</h2>

  Once you take control, the entire experience transforms.</p>
