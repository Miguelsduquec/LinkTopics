  <h1>No LinkedIn Ads: Does Blocking Ads Really Clean Your LinkedIn Feed?</h1>
  <p><em>Updated for 2026 — why removing ads helps, but doesn’t solve the real LinkedIn feed problem.</em></p>
</header>

<section>
  <p>If LinkedIn feels overwhelming, ads are often the first thing people blame. It’s no surprise that tools like <strong>No LinkedIn Ads</strong> have become popular.</p>

  <p>But once the ads are gone, many users still ask the same question:</p>

  <p><strong>“Why does my LinkedIn feed still feel noisy?”</strong></p>

  <p>In this article, we’ll look at what No LinkedIn Ads actually fixes — and what it doesn’t.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why LinkedIn Ads Are Only Part of the Problem</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn ads are visible and easy to dislike. They interrupt your scroll and feel commercial.</p>

  <p>But ads are just one layer of LinkedIn’s feed.</p>

  <p>On a typical scroll session, your feed also includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>posts liked or commented on by your connections,</li>
    <li>suggested posts from people you don’t follow,</li>
    <li>“Because you viewed…” recommendations,</li>
    <li>viral or engagement-driven content.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Even with ads removed, these elements continue to shape your experience.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Is No LinkedIn Ads?</h2>

  <p>No LinkedIn Ads is a browser extension built specifically to block sponsored and promoted content on LinkedIn.</p>

  <p>Its goal is straightforward: remove ads and make LinkedIn feel less commercial.</p>

  <p>Once installed, it runs automatically and hides many obvious ad formats.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What No LinkedIn Ads Does Well</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Focused purpose</strong> — it targets ads and promoted posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Simple setup</strong> — install and forget.</li>
    <li><strong>Lightweight</strong> — minimal performance impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Immediate relief</strong> — fewer sponsored interruptions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If ads are your main frustration, this can noticeably improve your experience.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Limitations of No LinkedIn Ads</h2>

  <p>Blocking ads does not equal cleaning the feed.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No control over algorithmic content</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Doesn’t remove “Liked by” or “Reacted by” posts</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Suggested posts remain visible</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>No topic filtering</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>No visibility</strong> into what’s being removed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a result, many users still see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>posts from strangers,</li>
    <li>content boosted by engagement rather than relevance,</li>
    <li>low-value posts that technically aren’t ads.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Ad Blockers Don’t Fix LinkedIn Feeds</h2>

  <p>Ad blockers treat LinkedIn like a website.</p>

  <p>But LinkedIn is a behavior-driven feed.</p>

  <p>The biggest sources of noise come from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>network activity,</li>
    <li>engagement signals,</li>
    <li>recommendation systems,</li>
    <li>content trends.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Generic ad blocking tools simply aren’t designed to understand this context.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>No LinkedIn Ads vs LinkTopics</h2>

  <p>The difference is not effectiveness — it’s scope.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No LinkedIn Ads</strong> focuses on sponsored content.</li>
    <li><strong>LinkTopics</strong> focuses on feed relevance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With LinkTopics, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>remove “Liked by” and reaction-based posts,</li>
    <li>hide suggested and recommended content,</li>
    <li>filter many promoted posts,</li>
    <li>choose which topics you want to see,</li>
    <li>see live counters of removed content.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Instead of just blocking ads, you shape the feed itself.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Who Should Use No LinkedIn Ads?</h2>

  <p>No LinkedIn Ads is a good choice if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>are mainly annoyed by ads,</li>
    <li>don’t mind algorithmic noise,</li>
    <li>want a simple, zero-configuration tool.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Who Should Use LinkTopics Instead?</h2>

  <p>LinkTopics is better if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>want to clean the entire feed, not just ads,</li>
    <li>care about relevance and focus,</li>
    <li>use LinkedIn daily for work or learning,</li>
    <li>feel drained by constant feed noise.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Final Verdict</h2>

  <p>No LinkedIn Ads does exactly what it promises — it blocks ads.</p>

  <p>But ads are only a small part of why LinkedIn feels overwhelming.</p>

  <p>If you want a feed that feels intentional, calm and relevant, you need more than an ad blocker. You need control.</p>
