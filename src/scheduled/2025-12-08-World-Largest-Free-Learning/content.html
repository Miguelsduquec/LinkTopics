        <p><em>Updated for 2026 — why your LinkedIn feed feels random, what the algorithm is really doing, and how to fix your feed so it finally makes sense again.</em></p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>Does your LinkedIn feed feel… <strong>broken</strong>?</p>
        <p>One minute you see a useful post from a colleague, and the next:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a viral meme from someone you don’t know,</li>
          <li>a “Liked by” post from a stranger,</li>
          <li>promoted content you never asked for.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’ve caught yourself thinking “How do I fix the LinkedIn algorithm?” — you’re definitely not alone.</p>
        <p>In this guide, we’ll break down:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>how the LinkedIn algorithm actually works in 2026,</li>
          <li>why your feed feels so random,</li>
          <li>what you can do with LinkedIn’s own settings,</li>
          <li>and how to truly <strong>clean your feed</strong> with the help of a smart filter.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Your LinkedIn Feed Feels Broken</h2>
        <p>The problem isn’t just that the algorithm is “bad”. The problem is that LinkedIn is trying to do several things at the same time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keep you on the platform as long as possible,</li>
          <li>show you content that creates engagement,</li>
          <li>serve ads and promoted posts that pay the bills,</li>
          <li>occasionally surface posts from people you actually care about.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In practice, this means your feed mixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>posts from people you follow,</li>
          <li>posts they liked or commented on,</li>
          <li>suggested posts based on topics and trends,</li>
          <li>promoted posts and ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When all of that gets blended together, your feed can start to feel noisy and random — especially if you’re using LinkedIn primarily for focused, professional work.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How the LinkedIn Algorithm Works in 2026 (Simplified)</h2>
        <p>You don’t need to know every technical detail, but understanding the basics helps you “train” the algorithm.</p>
        <p>In very simple terms, the LinkedIn algorithm looks at:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who you interact with</strong> (likes, comments, shares, DMs),</li>
          <li><strong>What topics you engage with</strong> (tech, HR, sales, AI, etc.),</li>
          <li><strong>What content keeps you scrolling</strong> (time on post, dwell time),</li>
          <li><strong>Which posts are performing well globally</strong> (viral content),</li>
          <li><strong>Which ads and promoted posts are targeting your profile</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The more you engage with a type of content, the more the algorithm assumes you want similar content. This can work in your favor — or completely backfire.</p>
        <p>Accidentally like a few low-quality posts? Comment on a random debate? Click on a clickbait article?<br>Suddenly your feed gets flooded with more of the same.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Can You “Reset” the LinkedIn Algorithm?</h2>
        <p>There is no official <strong>“reset feed”</strong> button on LinkedIn.</p>
        <p>But you can <em>influence</em> the algorithm in a few ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clean up who you follow,</li>
          <li>stop engaging with the content you don’t want more of,</li>
          <li>use LinkedIn settings to reduce certain types of noise,</li>
          <li>and use tools that filter the feed for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key idea is:</p>
        <p><strong>Stop feeding the algorithm with the wrong signals — and start sending the right ones.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 1 — Unfollow the Right People (Without Disconnecting)</h2>
        <p>One of the fastest ways to fix your LinkedIn feed is to <strong>unfollow</strong> accounts that constantly push low-value content.</p>
        <p>Important: unfollowing is not the same as removing a connection.</p>
        <p>When you unfollow someone:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you stay connected,</li>
          <li>you can still DM each other,</li>
          <li>you simply stop seeing their posts in your feed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>people who post or react to drama constantly,</li>
          <li>accounts that share vague motivational posts every day,</li>
          <li>companies that post irrelevant updates for your career.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This alone can make your feed feel more focused and less chaotic.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 2 — Hide Posts You Don’t Want More Of</h2>
        <p>Every time you see a post that makes you think “Why is this here?”, that’s an opportunity to train the algorithm.</p>
        <p>On any post, click the three-dot menu and choose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“I don’t want to see this”</strong>, or</li>
          <li><strong>“Show less posts like this”</strong> (if available).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It feels small, but over time these signals add up.</p>
        <p>The opposite is also true: if you scroll past content you actually like without engaging, LinkedIn gets a weak signal. Don’t be afraid to like and comment on posts that are genuinely valuable to you.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 3 — Be Intentional With What You Engage With</h2>
        <p>Think of your engagement as voting.</p>
        <p>Every like, comment or share is a vote that says:</p>
        <p><em>“More content like this, please.”</em></p>
        <p>If you engage with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>outrage posts,</li>
          <li>pointless debates,</li>
          <li>clickbait threads,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>… the algorithm will give you more of those.</p>
        <p>Instead, try to intentionally engage with posts that match how you want your feed to look:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>deep dives in your industry,</li>
          <li>practical career advice,</li>
          <li>case studies and breakdowns,</li>
          <li>technical content that makes you better at your job.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is one of the most underrated ways to “fix” your LinkedIn algorithm over time.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 4 — Tidy Up Notifications and Follows</h2>
        <p>Another reason your LinkedIn experience feels overwhelming is notification overload.</p>
        <p>When every like, comment and new post triggers a notification, you get pulled into content you don’t really care about.</p>
        <p>To fix this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Communications</strong> and turn off non-essential notifications.</li>
          <li>Stop following irrelevant hashtags and topics.</li>
          <li>Unsubscribe from notification emails you never open.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The fewer distractions you allow, the easier it is to use LinkedIn intentionally instead of reactively.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 5 — Go Beyond Settings: Use a LinkedIn Feed Cleaner</h2>
        <p>Everything we covered so far uses LinkedIn’s own controls. They help — but they also have limitations.</p>
        <p>Even after you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>unfollow noisy accounts,</li>
          <li>hide irrelevant posts,</li>
          <li>curate your engagement,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>… your feed can still be full of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Liked by” and “Reacted by” posts,</li>
          <li>suggested posts from strangers,</li>
          <li>promoted posts and subtle ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s where a dedicated LinkedIn feed cleaner can make a big difference.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Fixing Your Feed With LinkTopics</h2>
        <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> is a Chrome extension built specifically to fix the LinkedIn feed.</p>
        <p>Instead of trying to “hack” the algorithm from the inside, it works on top of LinkedIn and cleans what you see in your browser.</p>
        <p>Here’s how it helps you fix your feed:</p>

        <h3>1. Removes “Liked by” and “Reacted by” posts</h3>
        <p>No more random posts from strangers just because someone in your network liked them.</p>

        <h3>2. Hides suggested and recommended posts</h3>
        <p>Those “People are talking about…” and “Because you viewed…” posts can be removed in the background.</p>

        <h3>3. Filters out promoted posts and many ads</h3>
        <p>LinkTopics detects and hides many types of sponsored content and promoted posts, helping you cut down the noise.</p>

        <h3>4. Lets you choose what topics to keep</h3>
        <p>You can tell LinkTopics which topics you actually want to see more of, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tech and engineering,</li>
          <li>Sales and marketing,</li>
          <li>Recruiting and HR,</li>
          <li>Startups and entrepreneurship,</li>
          <li>AI and automation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>LinkTopics then keeps posts aligned with those topics and filters out a lot of the rest.</p>

        <h3>5. Works in real time as you scroll</h3>
        <p>You don’t have to micro-manage anything. Open LinkedIn, scroll as usual and let LinkTopics clean the feed as it loads.</p>

        <h2>FAQ — Fixing the LinkedIn Algorithm</h2>

        <h3>How do I fix my LinkedIn algorithm in 2026?</h3>
        <p>Start by unfollowing noisy profiles, hiding posts that don’t serve you and engaging only with content you want more of. Then, use a LinkedIn feed cleaner like LinkTopics to remove promoted posts, “Liked by” clutter and suggested content.</p>

        <h3>Why is my LinkedIn feed full of random posts?</h3>
        <p>Because the algorithm boosts content your connections interact with, as well as suggested and promoted posts. If you or your network engage with low-quality content, you’ll see more of it in your feed.</p>

        <h3>Can I reset my LinkedIn feed?</h3>
        <p>There’s no official reset button. However, you can “soft reset” your feed by unfollowing accounts, hiding irrelevant content and training the algorithm over time. External tools like LinkTopics give you additional control.</p>

        <h3>Is there a way to only see relevant posts on LinkedIn?</h3>
        <p>You can get much closer to that ideal by carefully curating who you follow and what you engage with, then using a feed filter to clean up the remaining noise.</p>

        <h3>What is the best way to clean my LinkedIn feed?</h3>
        <p>The best approach is a combination: use LinkedIn’s native controls to send the right signals, and then use a browser extension like LinkTopics to remove promoted posts, suggested content and “Liked by” clutter.</p>
