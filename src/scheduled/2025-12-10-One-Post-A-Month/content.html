  <h1>Posting Once a Month on LinkedIn Won’t Change Anything</h1>
  <p>Visibility on LinkedIn comes from consistency, not occasional effort.</p>

  <h2>The Myth of the “Once in a While” Strategy</h2>
  <p>Many professionals believe that posting sporadically is enough to stay visible. But on LinkedIn, this approach simply doesn’t work. With millions of posts published every day, an occasional update is lost almost instantly. Without consistency, the algorithm can't learn what your content is about or who should see it.</p>

  <h2>Why Frequency Matters More Than You Think</h2>
  <p>LinkedIn prioritizes creators who show up regularly. That doesn’t mean posting constantly — it means creating predictable patterns. Regular posting trains the algorithm to recognize your niche, expands your reach, and builds familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is what creates trust, and trust is what converts visibility into opportunities.</p>

  <h2>The Cost of Inconsistency</h2>
  <p>When you post once a month, several problems emerge:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your audience forgets who you are.</li>
    <li>You never gather enough data to understand what works.</li>
    <li>You lose momentum, making every new post feel like starting from zero.</li>
    <li>Opportunities go to people who remain top of mind.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In other words, you’re doing the work without getting the reward.</p>

  <h2>A Smarter, Sustainable Posting Rhythm</h2>
  <p>You don’t need to post every day. For most professionals, 2–3 posts per week is more than enough to grow steadily. This frequency creates rhythm, predictability, and recognizability. With a clear posting plan, people begin to associate you with specific topics — which is exactly how a personal brand forms.</p>

  <h2>Building a System That Works for You</h2>
  <p>Consistency becomes easier when you systemize it:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a list of topics you can write about repeatedly.</li>
    <li>Batch-write several posts at once to reduce pressure.</li>
    <li>Repurpose your best ideas into new formats.</li>
    <li>Engage with your audience to reinforce your visibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Compound Effect of Showing Up</h2>
  <p>Posting consistently builds momentum. Your reach increases, your engagement grows, more people recognize your name, and more opportunities appear organically. Over months, this compounds into brand authority that irregular posting simply cannot achieve.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>If you want LinkedIn to work for you, consistency is non-negotiable. Posting once a month won’t change your visibility or your career — but showing up regularly absolutely will.</p>
