        <h1>Posting Once a Month on LinkedIn Won’t Change Anything</h1>
        <p>Real visibility on LinkedIn comes from consistency, not occasional effort or random monthly posts.</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>The Myth of “Once in a While” Posting</h2>
        <p>Many professionals quietly hope that a single, well-written post once a month will be enough to “stay active” on LinkedIn. It isn’t. With millions of posts published, an occasional update disappears in hours — long before the algorithm or your audience can associate you with anything meaningful.</p>
        <p>LinkedIn works more like long-term fitness than a one-off sprint: small, repeated actions beat rare bursts of effort every time.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Frequency Matters More Than You Think</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn’s algorithm and your network both respond to patterns. When you post regularly, you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>train the algorithm to understand your topics and niche,</li>
          <li>become familiar to the people you want to reach,</li>
          <li>create more chances for the right post to land at the right time,</li>
          <li>gather data on what actually works instead of guessing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This doesn’t mean you need to post every day — but it does mean that one post a month is essentially invisible.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>The Cost of Inconsistency</h2>
        <p>When you only post once a month, several predictable things happen:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your audience forgets who you are between posts,</li>
          <li>you never gather enough feedback to refine your message,</li>
          <li>you lose momentum, so each new post feels like starting from zero,</li>
          <li>opportunities go to people who show up more often and stay top of mind.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In other words, you do the work — but you rarely get the compound effect that makes LinkedIn worthwhile.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>A Simple, Sustainable Posting Rhythm</h2>
        <p>You don’t need a complex content calendar. For most professionals, a basic rhythm like this is enough:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2–3 posts per week</strong> around clear topics,</li>
          <li>regular comments on posts from your ideal audience,</li>
          <li>short, focused sessions instead of endless scrolling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A typical week might look like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One value post (tips, checklist, how-to),</li>
          <li>One story or lesson (experience, mistake, reflection),</li>
          <li>One post that moves people closer to working with you (case study, invitation, soft CTA).</li>
        </ul>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Building a System That Works for You</h2>
        <p>Consistency becomes much easier when you treat LinkedIn like a system instead of a random habit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep a running list of topics you can talk about repeatedly.</li>
          <li>Batch-write 3–6 posts in one sitting so you’re never starting from a blank page.</li>
          <li>Repurpose your strongest ideas into carousels, threads or blog posts.</li>
          <li>Engage in the comments with people you want in your network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A clean feed helps here too. When you’re not battling <strong>LinkedIn feed clutter</strong> (ads, viral drama, random “Liked by” posts), it’s much easier to sit down, post and move on.</p>
        <p>If you’re curious about external perspectives on posting frequency and consistency, you can explore neutral resources like

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Protecting Your Focus While You Grow</h2>
        <p>One of the hidden blockers to consistency is distraction. If every time you open LinkedIn you get pulled into ads, drama and random threads, you’ll avoid the platform — or waste energy instead of creating.</p>
        <p>This is where tools like <strong>LinkTopics</strong> can help. Instead of relying on a generic <em>LinkedIn adblock</em> that only partially hides ads, LinkTopics can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>hide “Liked by” posts</strong> and reaction-driven clutter,</li>
          <li>remove many Sponsored posts more precisely than a generic blocker,</li>
          <li>reduce <strong>LinkedIn feed clutter</strong> before it reaches you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With less noise in the feed, it’s easier to maintain a consistent posting rhythm without burning out.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>A Simple 90-Day Challenge</h2>
        <p>You can treat consistency as an experiment rather than a life sentence. For the next 90 days:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>pick 2–3 posting days per week,</li>
          <li>stick to a small set of topics,</li>
          <li>limit your LinkedIn time to short, focused sessions,</li>
          <li>track profile views, connection requests and inbound opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Compare the results with your “one post a month” era. In most cases, the difference is not subtle.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>If you want LinkedIn to work for you, consistency is non-negotiable. Posting once a month won’t change your visibility, reputation or pipeline — but showing up regularly, with a clean feed and a simple system, absolutely will.</p>
