  <h1>Recruiters Scan a Profile in Just 7 Seconds — But Candidates Do the Same to Recruiters</h1>
  <p>Candidates now evaluate recruiters just as quickly — trust and clarity determine whether a conversation even starts.</p>

  <h2>The Shift in Recruiting Dynamics</h2>
  <p>For years, all the attention was on how recruiters evaluate candidates.  
  But hiring has changed: candidates now scrutinize recruiters with the same speed and expectations.</p>

  <p>To understand how perception shifts, you may also want to explore:

  <h2>What Candidates Look For</h2>
  <p>When a candidate views a recruiter’s profile, they instantly judge credibility, clarity and intent.  
  They want to know whether engaging is worth their time.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clear communication:</strong> Are roles explained simply and transparently?</li>
    <li><strong>Professional presence:</strong> Does your profile convey competence?</li>
    <li><strong>Human tone:</strong> Do you sound like a real person, not a script?</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Are expectations and requirements clearly stated?</li>
    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Do you appear to understand their industry?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Candidates now have more information, more choice, and more power — meaning your feed, tone and profile matter as much as their CV.</p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>Just like recruiters judge candidates in 7 seconds, candidates judge recruiters identically fast.  
  If your profile feels unclear, generic or overly templated, they move on.</p>

  <p>Even studies from  
    <a href="https://hbr.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Harvard Business Review</a>  
    show that first impressions heavily influence reply rates and perceived trust.

  <h2>Recruiting Is Now a Two-Way Relationship</h2>
  <p>The best recruiters already recognise this shift. They:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>personalize communication,</li>
    <li>use a human tone,</li>
    <li>avoid templates,</li>
    <li>maintain a clear, trustworthy profile,</li>
    <li>build rapport before asking for attention.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  In this new environment, professionalism, clarity and authenticity aren’t optional —  
  they determine whether a conversation even begins.</p>
