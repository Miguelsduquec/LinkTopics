  <h1>Your LinkedIn Feed Shapes Your Career</h1>
  <p>Your daily feed influences how you think, learn and make professional decisions — often more than you realise.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Your Feed Matters</h2>
  <p>Your LinkedIn feed is part of your learning environment. Every idea, opinion and discussion you see influences how you think, what you prioritise and how you grow. A curated feed reinforces clarity; a noisy feed reinforces distraction.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Information Drives Decisions</h2>
  <p>The content you consume sets the tone for your thinking. High-signal content helps you make better decisions and stay strategic. Low-quality content pushes you into reactive mode.</p>
  <p>This is why cleaning your feed — and removing distractions like “Liked by” posts, recommended posts and ads — is essential for long-term growth.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A Noisy Feed Slows You Down</h2>
  <p>Irrelevant content creates mental clutter and reduces your ability to focus. Over time, this affects your productivity, your momentum and even the opportunities you notice.</p>

  <h2>A Curated Feed Makes You Faster</h2>
  <p>When you intentionally choose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>whom you follow,</li>
    <li>which topics matter,</li>
    <li>and which posts deserve your attention,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>…your feed becomes a competitive advantage. You learn faster and stay ahead of people relying on algorithmic randomness.</p>
