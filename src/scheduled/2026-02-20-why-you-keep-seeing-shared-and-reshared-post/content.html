<section>
  <p>If your LinkedIn feed feels repetitive, shared and reshared posts are often the reason.</p>

  <p>You might scroll past the same idea several times — shared by different people, with little added context.</p>

  <p>This repetition is not accidental. It’s a core part of how LinkedIn distributes content.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How Shared Posts Spread Across the Network</h2>

  <p>When someone shares a post, LinkedIn treats it as fresh network activity.</p>

  <p>That activity can push the same post into multiple feeds, even if the original content is unchanged.</p>

  <p>The more people who reshare it, the more visibility it gains — regardless of whether it’s still useful to you.</p>
</section>

</figure>

<section>
  <h2>Why Repetition Hurts Feed Quality</h2>

  <p>Reshared posts crowd out original updates.</p>

  <p>Instead of seeing new ideas or perspectives, your feed fills with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the same post reframed multiple times,</li>
    <li>identical opinions repeated by different voices,</li>
    <li>content optimized for reach rather than relevance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Over time, this makes the feed feel noisier and less intentional.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Network Effect You Can’t Fully Control</h2>

  <p>Even if you curate who you follow, resharing bypasses that control.</p>

  <p>Posts spread because of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>network connections,</li>
    <li>social proof,</li>
    <li>visibility boosts from repeated sharing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is why feed control often feels incomplete, as discussed in:

      Your Feed Is Your Competitive Advantage
    </a>

  <h2>What LinkedIn Lets You Do About Reshared Posts</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn offers a few manual controls:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hide individual shared posts,</li>
    <li>unfollow people who reshare frequently,</li>
    <li>limit engagement with repetitive content.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn explains hiding and muting options here:

       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      LinkedIn Help — Hide and mute feed content
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>These actions help, but they require constant maintenance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Manual Cleanup Doesn’t Scale</h2>

  <p>Reshared posts are generated by ongoing network behavior.</p>

  <p>As long as people keep sharing, repetition continues — even if you hide individual items.</p>

  <p>This limitation is explored in more detail here:

  <h2>How LinkTopics Reduces Reshared Noise</h2>

  <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> filters reshared posts directly in the feed.</p>

  <p>This helps keep your feed focused on original posts and relevant updates without requiring daily cleanup.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Shared and reshared posts are powerful distribution tools — but they come at a cost.</p>

  <p>Once repetition dominates the feed, relevance drops.</p>

  <p><strong>If you want a feed that stays useful without constant effort, reducing reshared noise is essential.</strong></p>
