  <h1>How to Clean Your LinkedIn Feed Manually (And Why It Doesn’t Scale)</h1>
  <p><em>Updated for 2026 — what manual LinkedIn feed cleanup gets right, and where it breaks down.</em></p>
</header>

<section>
  <p>Many professionals try to clean their LinkedIn feed without using any tools.</p>

  <p>At first, this approach feels responsible and effective. You unfollow a few accounts, hide some posts, and the feed improves.</p>

  <p>But then, slowly, the noise comes back.</p>

  <p><strong>This article explains why.</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why People Try to Clean Their LinkedIn Feed Manually</h2>

  <p>Manual cleanup feels like the “correct” solution:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>no extensions,</li>
    <li>no third-party tools,</li>
    <li>just using LinkedIn as intended.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn itself encourages this behavior through options like unfollowing, hiding posts, and muting topics.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Manual LinkedIn Feed Cleanup Actually Involves</h2>

  <p>Cleaning your feed manually usually means doing some or all of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>unfollowing people while staying connected,</li>
    <li>hiding posts you don’t want to see again,</li>
    <li>muting hashtags and topics,</li>
    <li>reducing notifications,</li>
    <li>engaging only with content you like.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn explains some of these controls in their official help documentation:
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a567336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      LinkedIn Help — Unfollow, mute, and hide posts
    </a>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Works Well With Manual Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unfollowing noisy accounts</strong> reduces repeated low-value posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Hiding irrelevant posts</strong> sends better signals to the algorithm.</li>
    <li><strong>Intentional engagement</strong> helps shape what you see over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the short term, this can noticeably improve your feed.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Manual LinkedIn Feed Cleanup Doesn’t Scale</h2>

  <p>The core problem is simple:</p>

  <p><strong>The LinkedIn algorithm never stops.</strong></p>

  <p>Even after careful cleanup, your feed continues to include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>posts liked or commented on by your connections,</li>
    <li>suggested posts from outside your network,</li>
    <li>engagement-driven or viral content,</li>
    <li>promoted posts and subtle ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each new interaction from your network reintroduces noise.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Hidden Cost of Manual Cleanup</h2>

  <p>Manual feed cleanup also has hidden downsides:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It requires constant attention.</li>
    <li>You need to make decisions on every scroll.</li>
    <li>The results are inconsistent.</li>
    <li>New noise appears faster than you can remove it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Over time, this leads to frustration and burnout.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Manual Cleanup vs Understanding the Algorithm</h2>

  <p>Manual actions help, but they don’t override the system.</p>

  <p>If you want to understand why LinkedIn behaves this way, read our guide on
    <a href="/blog/fix-linkedin-algorithm-2026">
      how the LinkedIn algorithm works in 2026
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>The takeaway is clear: the algorithm optimizes for engagement, not focus.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>When Manual Cleanup Is Not Enough</h2>

  <p>Manual cleanup breaks down if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use LinkedIn daily,</li>
    <li>follow hundreds or thousands of connections,</li>
    <li>work in fast-moving industries,</li>
    <li>value focus and relevance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At that point, the effort required outweighs the benefit.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How LinkTopics Complements Manual Cleanup</h2>

  <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> doesn’t replace good habits — it supports them.</p>

  <p>Instead of fighting the feed manually, LinkTopics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hides “Liked by” and reaction-based posts,</li>
    <li>removes suggested and recommended content,</li>
    <li>filters many promoted posts,</li>
    <li>lets you choose which topics you want to see,</li>
    <li>cleans the feed automatically as you scroll.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Verdict</h2>

  <p>Cleaning your LinkedIn feed manually works — briefly.</p>

  <p>But because the platform constantly injects new content, manual cleanup alone doesn’t scale.</p>

  <p>For professionals who want a calm, relevant feed without constant effort, combining good habits with a dedicated feed cleaner is the most sustainable approach.</p>
