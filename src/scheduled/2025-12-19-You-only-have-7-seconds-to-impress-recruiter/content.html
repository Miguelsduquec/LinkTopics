  <h1>You Only Have 7 Seconds to Impress a Recruiter on LinkedIn</h1>
  <p>Recruiters skim LinkedIn profiles fast — and your first impression determines whether they keep reading.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>The Reality of Modern Recruitment</h2>
  <p>Recruiters often review hundreds of profiles per role. They rely on rapid pattern-matching to decide who deserves attention, which means your profile must communicate professionalism and clarity immediately.</p>

  <p>To better understand why your feed also impacts visibility, read  
    <a href="/blog/why-your-linkedin-feed-feels-messy">why your LinkedIn feed feels messy</a>.

<section>
  <h2>The First Things Recruiters Look At</h2>
  <p>In the first 7 seconds, recruiters scan for key signals:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Profile photo:</strong> clear, confident, friendly.</li>
    <li><strong>Headline:</strong> value-based, not just a job title.</li>
    <li><strong>Current role:</strong> relevant to the role they're filling.</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> often a mandatory filter.</li>
    <li><strong>First lines of the About section:</strong> clarity > length.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Headlines Matter More Than You Think</h2>
  <p>Your headline appears everywhere: comments, messages, search results, connection requests. A strong headline instantly communicates expertise and positioning — two things recruiters evaluate before anything else.</p>

    </a>

<section>
  <h2>Optimising Your About Section</h2>
  <p>Your About section should start like a pitch: short, clear and aligned with your strengths. The first two lines determine whether a recruiter continues reading — or moves on.</p>

  <p>Write with intention. Avoid clichés. Lead with value.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Small Tweaks With the Biggest Impact</h2>
  <p>You don’t need a full rewrite. Start with these:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Update your photo with a clean, modern headshot.</li>
    <li>Rewrite your headline to reflect what you actually offer.</li>
    <li>Ensure the first lines of your About section tell a compelling story.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These elements shape 90% of first impressions.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>You can’t control how long recruiters look — but you can control what they see first. Optimise your headline, image, and opening lines, and those 7 seconds will work in your favour.</p>
