  <p>Your information diet determines the quality of your thinking and decisions.</p>

  <h2>The Content You Consume Shapes Your Outcomes</h2>

They don’t let the algorithm decide what they see — they curate their feed intentionally.</p>

  <h2>Why Inputs Matter More Than You Think</h2>
  <p>Your results don’t just come from what you do. They come from how you think. And your thinking is shaped by the content, conversations, and insights you consume daily. This is why the highest performers carefully control who they follow, what they read, and what they allow into their mental space.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>The Power of a Curated Feed</h2>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
