  <h1>Top Performers on LinkedIn All Share One Habit: They Control What They Consume</h1>
  <p>Your information diet determines the quality of your thinking and the decisions you make.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>The Content You Consume Shapes Your Outcomes</h2>
  <p>Most professionals underestimate how much their LinkedIn feed influences their mindset and performance.  
  Top performers know their attention is their most valuable resource — and they protect it intentionally.</p>

  <p>Studies from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">McKinsey</a> show that mental overload directly reduces productivity and decision quality.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Inputs Matter More Than You Think</h2>
  <p>Your results come not just from your actions, but from the thoughts that drive them.  
  And those thoughts are shaped by the ideas, conversations, and signals entering your mind every day.</p>

  <p>This is why high performers deliberately control their information feed — and why many use tools to <strong>clean their LinkedIn feed</strong>, remove ads, and hide “Liked by” clutter.</p>

  <h2>What Top Performers Do Differently</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>They follow fewer people — but the right ones.</li>
    <li>They avoid noise, drama, and low-value content.</li>
    <li>They prioritize insights from experts and peers.</li>
    <li>They treat their feed like a strategic advantage, not entertainment.</li>
  </ul>
