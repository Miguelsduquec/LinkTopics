<section>
  <p>Suggested posts are often the most confusing elements in the LinkedIn feed.</p>

  <p>They appear without a clear connection to people you follow or topics you intentionally chose.</p>

  <p>For many users, this creates the impression that the feed is increasingly driven by exploration rather than relevance.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What LinkedIn Means by “Suggested”</h2>

  <p>Suggested posts are designed to introduce you to new content.</p>

  <p>They typically surface:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>posts from accounts you don’t follow,</li>
    <li>topics LinkedIn wants you to discover,</li>
    <li>content performing well outside your network.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The intention is discovery, not personalization.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Suggested Posts Often Feel Irrelevant</h2>

  <p>Suggestion systems rely on broad signals.</p>

  <p>That means they often prioritize:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>general popularity over personal relevance,</li>
    <li>exploration over intent,</li>
    <li>engagement potential over usefulness.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is why suggested posts frequently miss the context of why you use LinkedIn.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Accumulated Effect on Your Feed</h2>

  <p>One suggested post is easy to ignore.</p>

  <p>But over time, they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>push relevant posts further down,</li>
    <li>increase scrolling friction,</li>
    <li>reduce the sense of control.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This effect is part of a broader feed problem:

<section>
  <h2>What You Can Do Using Native Controls</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn offers limited options for suggested posts.</p>

  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hide individual suggestions,</li>
    <li>avoid engaging with irrelevant topics,</li>
    <li>unfollow sources that trigger repeated suggestions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn explains these options here:
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a567336"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      LinkedIn Help — Hide and mute feed content
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>These actions help, but they don’t stop suggestions entirely.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Manual Filtering Doesn’t Scale</h2>

  <p>Suggested posts are continuously recalculated.</p>

  <p>Even if you hide several today, new ones appear tomorrow.</p>

  <p>This limitation is explained in more detail here:

<section>
  <h2>How LinkTopics Reduces Suggested Posts</h2>

  <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> filters suggested posts directly in the LinkedIn feed.</p>

  <p>This allows you to keep focus on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>people you actually follow,</li>
    <li>topics you deliberately choose,</li>
    <li>original content instead of algorithmic exploration.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Suggested posts are designed to broaden what you see.</p>

  <p>They are not designed to respect your priorities.</p>

  <p><strong>If you want a feed that stays intentional with less effort, reducing suggested noise is essential.</strong></p>
