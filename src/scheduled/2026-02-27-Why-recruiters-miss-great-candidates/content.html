<section>
  <p>Most recruiters believe they would recognize a great candidate if they saw one.</p>

  <p>The reality is more uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Many strong candidates post subtle signals on LinkedIn that never surface clearly in a noisy feed.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Recruiters Expect to See — And What They Actually See</h2>

  <p>In theory, LinkedIn should surface:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>career transitions,</li>
    <li>role changes and promotions,</li>
    <li>professionals sharing thoughtful industry insights.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In practice, recruiters see a feed dominated by engagement bait, ads, and unrelated content.</p>

<section>
  <h2>How Feed Noise Hides Hiring Signals</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn’s algorithm amplifies content that generates reactions.</p>

  <p>This creates an imbalance where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>viral posts overshadow career updates,</li>
    <li>high engagement replaces hiring relevance,</li>
    <li>important signals disappear between distractions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Recruiters often scroll past signals without recognizing them.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Timing Problem in Talent Acquisition</h2>

  <p>Recruiting is highly time-sensitive.</p>

  <p>When signals are missed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>candidates move first,</li>
    <li>competitors engage sooner,</li>
    <li>outbound sourcing increases.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This raises effort while lowering success rates.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Manual Feed Cleanup Isn’t Enough</h2>

  <p>Recruiters try to adapt by hiding posts and unfollowing noisy accounts.</p>

  <p>But feed noise regenerates continuously.</p>

  <p>This creates the same limitation described here:

<section>
  <h2>How LinkTopics Helps Recruiters See What Matters</h2>

  <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> removes noise patterns directly in the feed.</p>

  <p>This allows recruiters to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>spot career signals faster,</li>
    <li>focus on relevant professional updates,</li>
    <li>reduce time spent scrolling.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Recruiters don’t miss candidates because they lack skill.</p>

  <p>They miss them because the feed hides what matters.</p>

  <p><strong>A cleaner feed restores visibility to the signals that drive better hiring decisions.</strong></p>
