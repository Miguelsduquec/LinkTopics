<section>
  <p>Noisy professional feeds rarely feel dangerous.</p>

  <p>They feel normal. Entertaining. Easy to ignore.</p>

  <p>The real cost appears slowly — and compounds over time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Creates Noise in Professional Feeds</h2>

  <p>Most professional feeds are optimized for engagement.</p>

  <p>This results in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>high-volume opinion content,</li>
    <li>reaction-driven posts,</li>
    <li>constant novelty.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Relevance becomes secondary.</p>

<section>
  <h2>The Cognitive Cost Most Professionals Miss</h2>

  <p>Each low-signal interaction consumes attention.</p>

  <p>Over time, this leads to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>shorter focus cycles,</li>
    <li>increased mental fatigue,</li>
    <li>reduced depth of thinking.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The damage is subtle but cumulative.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How Feed Noise Distorts Professional Priorities</h2>

  <p>Feeds influence what feels important.</p>

  <p>When noise dominates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>urgent replaces important,</li>
    <li>trends overshadow fundamentals,</li>
    <li>reaction displaces reflection.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This quietly reshapes decision making.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Awareness Alone Doesn’t Fix the Problem</h2>

  <p>Knowing the feed is noisy does not remove its influence.</p>

  <p>Exposure still fragments attention.</p>

  <p>This mirrors the limitation discussed here:

<section>
  <h2>How Reducing Feed Noise Changes Outcomes</h2>

  <p>Professionals who reduce feed noise often experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>longer attention spans,</li>
    <li>clearer thinking,</li>
    <li>better decision timing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Small changes compound into meaningful advantages.</p>
