  <h1>How to Customize Your LinkedIn Feed (Settings You Didn’t Know)</h1>
  <p><em>Updated for 2026 — the LinkedIn feed controls most people never use, and why they only go so far.</em></p>
</header>

<section>
  <p>If your LinkedIn feed feels random, noisy or exhausting, you might assume there’s nothing you can do about it.</p>

  <p>But LinkedIn actually offers more customization options than most users realize.</p>

  <p>The problem?</p>

  <p><strong>They’re scattered, limited, and easy to overlook.</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why LinkedIn Feed Customization Feels Hidden</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn doesn’t present feed controls as a single dashboard.</p>

  <p>Instead, customization happens through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>small actions inside posts,</li>
    <li>settings buried in menus,</li>
    <li>behavior-based signals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This makes feed customization feel unintuitive — even though it exists.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>1. Unfollow Without Disconnecting</h2>

  <p>One of the most powerful LinkedIn feed settings is also the least used: <strong>Unfollow</strong>.</p>

  <p>Unfollowing someone:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>keeps the connection,</li>
    <li>keeps DMs open,</li>
    <li>removes their posts from your feed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is ideal for noisy posters you don’t want to offend.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Hide Posts and Train the Algorithm</h2>

  <p>Every post menu includes options like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“I don’t want to see this”,</li>
    <li>“Show less posts like this”.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Using these options sends negative signals to the algorithm.</p>

  <p>LinkedIn explains this behavior-based filtering in their help center:
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a567336"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      LinkedIn Help — Hide and mute feed content
    </a>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Mute Topics and Hashtags</h2>

  <p>Following hashtags influences your feed more than most users realize.</p>

  <p>If your feed is full of trends you don’t care about, check:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>which hashtags you follow,</li>
    <li>which topics you’ve interacted with historically.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Unfollowing or muting irrelevant hashtags reduces repeated noise.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Control Notifications to Control the Feed</h2>

  <p>Notifications drive engagement — and engagement drives feed content.</p>

  <p>If you’re constantly pulled into:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>reaction notifications,</li>
    <li>comment threads,</li>
    <li>random updates,</li>
  </ul>

  <p>…the algorithm assumes you want more of that content.</p>

  <p>Reducing notifications helps reduce feed chaos.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Engage Intentionally (This Matters More Than You Think)</h2>

  <p>Every like, comment or share is a vote.</p>

  <p>If you engage with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>outrage posts,</li>
    <li>low-effort content,</li>
    <li>clickbait discussions,</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn will show you more of the same.</p>

  <p>This is explained in more detail in our guide:
    <a href="/blog/fix-linkedin-algorithm-2026">
      How to Fix the LinkedIn Algorithm (2026 Guide)
    </a>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Hard Truth: Native Settings Have Limits</h2>

  <p>Even if you use every setting correctly, LinkedIn will still show:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Liked by” and reaction-based posts,</li>
    <li>suggested content from outside your network,</li>
    <li>promoted posts and subtle ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is because the feed is designed for engagement — not focus.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Customization Alone Doesn’t Scale</h2>

  <p>Manual customization requires:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>constant attention,</li>
    <li>ongoing decisions,</li>
    <li>continuous re-training of the algorithm.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Over time, most users stop maintaining it.</p>

  <p>This is why manual cleanup eventually fails, as explained here:

</section>

<section>
  <h2>How LinkTopics Extends LinkedIn’s Native Settings</h2>

  <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> works on top of LinkedIn’s settings.</p>

  <p>Instead of replacing them, it automates what most users try to do manually:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hide “Liked by” posts,</li>
    <li>remove suggested content,</li>
    <li>filter ads and promoted posts,</li>
    <li>keep only relevant topics.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The feed stays clean without constant intervention.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Verdict</h2>

  <p>Yes — you can customize your LinkedIn feed.</p>

  <p>But LinkedIn’s native settings are fragmented and limited by design.</p>

  <p><strong>For users who want real control without constant effort, combining settings with a feed cleaner is the most effective approach.</strong></p>
