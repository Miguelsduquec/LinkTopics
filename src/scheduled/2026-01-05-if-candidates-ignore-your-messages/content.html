  <h1>If Candidates Ignore Your Messages… It’s Not the Message</h1>
  <p>The recruiting landscape has changed, and candidates no longer respond to generic outreach.</p>

  <h2>Why Candidates Skip Messages Today</h2>
  <p>Candidates are overwhelmed with notifications, overwhelmed with choices, and overwhelmed with templated outreach. Every day, they receive dozens of messages that look, feel, and sound exactly the same. The problem isn’t your wording — it’s that your message doesn’t stand out in a sea of sameness.</p>

  <h2>The Real Reason Your Outreach Is Being Ignored</h2>
  <p>Recruiters often assume they need a better script. But in reality, the issue is attention. Candidates respond to what feels relevant, personal, and intentional. A message that shows understanding of their journey instantly separates you from the rest.</p>

  <h2>What Actually Gets Responses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Mention something from their profile or activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Explain why they might be a strong fit.</li>
    <li><strong>Human tone:</strong> Talk like a person, not a template.</li>
    <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> Show that you read more than their job title.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Keep the message short and thoughtful.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recruiting Is Now About Context</h2>
  <p>In modern recruiting, the message matters — but the context matters more. Candidates respond when they feel seen, not targeted. The recruiters who adapt to this shift will win the attention others are losing.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>If candidates aren’t replying, don’t rewrite the script — rethink the strategy behind it. The best messages feel like conversations, not campaigns.</p>
