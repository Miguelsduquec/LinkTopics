  <h1>If Candidates Ignore Your Messages… It’s Not the Message</h1>
  <p>Candidates aren’t rejecting your wording — they’re rejecting what feels generic, templated, or irrelevant.</p>

  <h2>Why Candidates Skip Messages Today</h2>
  <p>Candidates live in a world of constant notifications. Their inboxes are full of outreach that sounds identical: same greetings, same templates, same structure. The problem isn’t your grammar — it’s the lack of distinction.</p>
