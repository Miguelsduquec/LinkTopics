        <p><em>Updated for 2026 — why you keep seeing more and more promoted posts on LinkedIn, what you can do with native settings, why generic adblockers don’t help, and how to truly clean your feed.</em></p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>Open LinkedIn today and scroll for 10 seconds.</p>
        <p>Chances are you’ll see at least one of these:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Promoted posts</strong> disguised as normal content,</li>
          <li><strong>Sponsored</strong> updates in the middle of your feed,</li>
          <li>Subtle ads blended with “thought leadership” posts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In 2026, LinkedIn relies more than ever on promoted posts and ads. For many users, that means one thing:</p>
        <p><strong>The feed feels like a never-ending ad roll.</strong></p>
        <p>If you’re tired of that and you’re searching for things like “how to remove promoted posts on LinkedIn” or “linkedin adblock”, this guide is for you. If you also want to remove all kinds of ads and banners beyond promoted posts, check our broader guide on <a href="/blog/remove-ads-and-noise-on-linkedin">how to remove ads and noise on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
        <p>Let’s walk through what’s possible with LinkedIn’s settings, why traditional adblockers don’t work well, and how you can actually clean your feed.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What Are Promoted Posts on LinkedIn?</h2>
        <p>Promoted posts are <strong>paid ads</strong> that appear in your feed and look almost exactly like normal posts. They usually include a small label such as “Promoted” or “Sponsored”.</p>
        <p>Advertisers pay LinkedIn to show these posts to you, even if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you don’t follow the company,</li>
          <li>you’ve never interacted with their content,</li>
          <li>you’re not interested in their product at all.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From LinkedIn’s point of view, this is normal. Ads fund the platform. But from your point of view as a user, these promoted posts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>break the flow of useful content,</li>
          <li>push irrelevant offers and products,</li>
          <li>make your feed feel noisy and unprofessional.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why You’re Seeing More Promoted Posts in 2026</h2>
        <p>There are three core reasons why promoted posts feel more aggressive than ever in 2026:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Revenue pressure.</strong> Like every big platform, LinkedIn is under pressure to grow ad revenue. That means more sponsored slots in your feed.</li>
          <li><strong>Better targeting.</strong> The more data LinkedIn has, the more it can sell targeted ads. That leads to a higher volume of promoted posts.</li>
          <li><strong>Blended design.</strong> Promoted posts are now designed to look almost identical to organic posts, which makes them feel more intrusive.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The result: even if you use LinkedIn for serious, professional reasons, you still get a constant stream of ads and sponsored messages.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Can You Hide Promoted Posts on LinkedIn Using Settings?</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn does not offer a toggle like “Disable promoted posts” or “Remove sponsored content”.</p>
        <p>However, you can reduce the noise a little by using the native controls:</p>

        <h3>1. Hide individual ads</h3>
        <p>On any promoted post, click the three-dot menu and choose <strong>“I don’t want to see this ad”</strong>. You can sometimes specify a reason, such as “Irrelevant” or “Repetitive”.</p>

        <h3>2. Adjust ad preferences</h3>
        <p>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Advertising</strong> and review your ad preferences. You can disable certain categories of targeted ads or reduce how your data is used for advertising.</p>

        <h3>3. Unfollow noisy company pages</h3>
        <p>Some promoted content comes from companies you already follow. Unfollowing them may reduce some sponsored posts.</p>

        <p>These steps help <strong>a bit</strong>, but they will never remove all promoted posts. LinkedIn will always find new ways to show you ads.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why a Generic “LinkedIn Adblock” Extension Usually Fails</h2>
        <p>If you’ve searched for solutions before, you might have tried:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Installing a browser-wide adblocker (AdBlock, uBlock Origin, etc.),</li>
          <li>Searching for “linkedin adblock” on the Chrome Web Store,</li>
          <li>Using filters meant for other websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes these tools can block obvious banner ads. But LinkedIn’s promoted posts are different:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They are rendered as <strong>feed elements</strong>, not separate ad frames.</li>
          <li>They use dynamic classes and markup that can change frequently.</li>
          <li>They mimic organic posts visually, making them harder to target with simple rules.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s why a generic “linkedin adblock” approach almost always breaks over time: LinkedIn changes the feed; your filters don’t keep up. We explain this in more detail in <a href="/blog/switching-from-a-generic-ad-blocker-to-linktopics">our guide on switching from a generic ad blocker to LinkTopics</a>.</p>
        <p>To reliably remove promoted posts from your feed, you need a tool that actually understands the LinkedIn feed structure and is actively maintained.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>A Better Approach: Clean the Feed, Not Just the Ads</h2>
        <p>If all you do is block ads, your feed can still feel noisy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/blog/liked-by-posts-clutter-your-feed">“Liked by” posts from strangers</a>,</li>
          <li><a href="/blog/why-linkedin-shows-so-many-suggested-posts">Suggested posts</a>,</li>
          <li>Random viral content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The real goal isn’t just “no ads”. The real goal is:</p>
        <p><strong>A clean, relevant, professional feed.</strong></p>
        <p>That means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keeping the posts that matter to your career,</li>
          <li>removing the content that wastes your time,</li>
          <li>staying on LinkedIn, but on your own terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is exactly what <strong>LinkTopics</strong> is built to do.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How LinkTopics Removes Promoted Posts on LinkedIn</h2>
        <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> is a Chrome extension designed specifically to fix the LinkedIn feed. Instead of acting like a generic “linkedin adblock”, it works as a <strong>smart feed filter</strong>.</p>
        <p>Here’s what it can do for you:</p>

        <h3>1. Detect and hide promoted posts</h3>
        <p>LinkTopics scans your feed as you scroll and detects many types of promoted posts and sponsored updates. When it finds them, it hides them automatically.</p>

        <h3>2. Remove other clutter at the same time</h3>
        <p>Beyond just ads, LinkTopics can also remove:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Liked by” and “Reacted by” posts,</li>
          <li>Suggested and recommended posts,</li>
          <li>Other semi-promotional blocks that distract you from actual content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Keep the topics you care about</h3>
        <p>Instead of blocking everything, you can tell LinkTopics which topics you want to see more of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tech &amp; engineering,</li>
          <li>Sales &amp; marketing,</li>
          <li>Recruiting &amp; HR,</li>
          <li>Startups &amp; entrepreneurship,</li>
          <li>AI &amp; automation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>LinkTopics keeps posts aligned with your chosen topics and quietly removes the rest, including many promoted posts and irrelevant ads.</p>

        <h3>4. Works in real time</h3>
        <p>As you scroll your LinkedIn feed, LinkTopics works instantly in the background. You don’t have to click anything or maintain any filters.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Reduce LinkedIn Ads Today</h2>
        <p>If you’re not ready to install anything yet, here’s a practical process you can start with right now:</p>

        <h3>Step 1 — Hide obviously irrelevant ads</h3>
        <p>Whenever you see a completely irrelevant promoted post, click the three dots and select <strong>“I don’t want to see this ad”</strong>. Over time, this helps LinkedIn learn what not to show you.</p>

        <h3>Step 2 — Review your ad preferences</h3>
        <p>In <strong>Settings &gt; Advertising</strong>, turn off categories you don’t care about and reduce how your data is used for targeted ads.</p>

        <h3>Step 3 — Unfollow or mute noisy sources</h3>
        <p>Unfollow company pages that you never want to see again. This won’t remove all sponsored content, but it reduces repetition.</p>

        <h3>Step 4 — Use a dedicated LinkedIn feed cleaner</h3>
        <p>When you’re ready to go further, install a LinkedIn-specific feed filter like LinkTopics so you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>hide promoted posts and ads,</li>
          <li>remove “Liked by” posts,</li>
          <li>clean suggested and recommended content,</li>
          <li>focus only on posts that matter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FAQ — Promoted Posts and LinkedIn Ads</h2>

        <h3>Can I hide promoted posts on LinkedIn?</h3>
        <p>You can hide individual promoted posts using the three-dot menu, but there is no global setting to disable all sponsored content. For a more complete solution, you need a LinkedIn-specific feed filter like LinkTopics.</p>

        <h3>Does a generic adblocker remove LinkedIn ads?</h3>
        <p>Generic adblockers often fail on LinkedIn because promoted posts are embedded inside the feed and designed to look like normal content. A generic “linkedin adblock” extension rarely keeps up with these changes over time.</p>

        <h3>Why am I seeing more promoted posts on LinkedIn in 2026?</h3>
        <p>LinkedIn increasingly relies on sponsored content for revenue. As a result, promoted posts and ads occupy more space in your feed than in previous years.</p>

        <h3>Is there a LinkedIn ad blocker that actually works?</h3>
        <p>Instead of relying on a generic adblocker, consider using a LinkedIn-specific tool such as LinkTopics. It understands the structure of the LinkedIn feed and can hide many ads, promoted posts and other forms of clutter.</p>

        <h3>How can I clean my LinkedIn feed without leaving the platform?</h3>
        <p>Unfollow noisy accounts, hide irrelevant posts and adjust your settings. For deeper control, use a browser extension like LinkTopics to filter out promoted posts, ads and other distractions while still using LinkedIn as normal.</p>
