<section>
  <p>LinkedIn has a dedicated Jobs tab — yet job posts still appear regularly in the main feed.</p>

  <p>For users not actively job hunting, this content often feels misplaced and disruptive.</p>

  <p>The reason is tied to how LinkedIn distributes engagement-driven content.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Job Posts Are Treated Like Feed Content</h2>

  <p>Job posts are not just listings. They are engagement units.</p>

  <p>When someone:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>shares a role,</li>
    <li>likes a job post,</li>
    <li>comments on a hiring update,</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn may surface that activity in the feed.</p>
</section>

</figure>

<section>
  <h2>Why Job Posts Often Feel Irrelevant</h2>

  <p>Feed-based job distribution ignores intent.</p>

  <p>You may see roles because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>someone in your network engaged with them,</li>
    <li>they match a past title,</li>
    <li>they are being promoted broadly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This leads to job content appearing even when you’re not looking.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Cost of Job Noise in the Feed</h2>

  <p>For professionals using LinkedIn to learn, sell, or build visibility, job posts create friction.</p>

  <p>Common effects include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>less room for relevant updates,</li>
    <li>more scrolling to find signal,</li>
    <li>a fragmented feed experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This reinforces the idea that attention is shaped by what the feed prioritizes:

      Your Feed Is Your Competitive Advantage
    </a>

<section>
  <h2>What LinkedIn Lets You Do</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn provides limited manual controls:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hide individual job-related posts,</li>
    <li>reduce engagement with job content,</li>
    <li>adjust job alert preferences.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>LinkedIn documents content hiding here:
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a567336"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      LinkedIn Help — Hide and mute feed content
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>These actions help, but they don’t keep job posts out permanently.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Manual Control Doesn’t Scale</h2>

  <p>As long as your network engages with job posts, they keep appearing.</p>

  <p>This creates the same scalability problem described here:

  <h2>How LinkTopics Filters Job Posts</h2>

  <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> allows users to remove job-related posts from the feed.</p>

  <p>This keeps the main feed focused on content, while job discovery stays where it belongs — in the Jobs tab.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Job posts serve a purpose, but not in every feed.</p>

  <p>Once they start displacing relevant content, they become noise.</p>

  <p><strong>If you want a feed aligned with your current goals, separating jobs from content is a key step.</strong></p>
