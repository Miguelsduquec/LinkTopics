<p>If your LinkedIn feed is constantly showing “Suggested Posts”, “Because you follow…”, or “Trending now”, you’re not imagining it — LinkedIn has dramatically increased the amount of algorithm-driven content in 2025. While some suggestions can be useful, most of them are irrelevant, distracting, or simply not aligned with your professional goals.</p>

<p>In this guide, you’ll learn why LinkedIn shows Suggested Posts, how to manually hide them, and the easiest way to remove them automatically so your feed stays focused and professional.</p>

<h2>Why LinkedIn shows so many Suggested Posts</h2>
<p>LinkedIn uses Suggested Posts to increase engagement and keep users scrolling longer. These posts are based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Topics you follow</li>
  <li>Pages you interacted with</li>
  <li>What’s trending in your region</li>
  <li>Posts with high engagement</li>
</ul>

<p>But the reality is simple: Suggested Posts help LinkedIn boost activity, not your productivity.</p>

<h2>Why Suggested Posts are a problem</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>They bury real updates</strong> from people and companies you actually follow.</li>
  <li><strong>They show viral content</strong> that often has nothing to do with your work.</li>
  <li><strong>They waste time</strong> by distracting you from meaningful professional content.</li>
  <li><strong>They make the feed feel more like Facebook</strong> and less like a business tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're trying to work, learn or network efficiently, Suggested Posts can be one of the biggest sources of noise.</p>

<h2>How to hide Suggested Posts manually</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, LinkedIn does not provide a native setting to disable Suggested Posts globally. The only built-in method is hiding individual suggestions, one by one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the three dots (…) on the Suggested Post.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>“I don’t want to see this”</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose a reason such as <em>Not relevant</em> or <em>Not interested</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem? This is temporary. LinkedIn will continue to show new Suggested Posts in the next refresh.</p>

<h2>The easiest way to remove Suggested Posts automatically</h2>
<p>The most effective way to hide Suggested Posts in 2025 is by using a browser extension that removes them the moment they appear. One of the most reliable tools for this is <strong>LinkTopics</strong>.</p>

<p>With LinkTopics, you can automatically hide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suggested Posts (“Because you follow…”, “Trending now…”, “People are talking about…”)</li>
  <li>Sponsored and Promoted posts</li>
  <li>“Liked by” reaction posts</li>
  <li>Other irrelevant feed clutter</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to enable the filter in LinkTopics</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Install LinkTopics from the Chrome Web Store.</li>
  <li>Open LinkedIn in a browser tab.</li>
  <li>Click the LinkTopics icon in your toolbar.</li>
  <li>Enable the option <strong>Hide Suggested Posts</strong>.</li>
  <li>Refresh your feed.</li>
</ol>

<p>From now on, Suggested Posts disappear automatically — no manual clicking required.</p>

<h2>Why using a dedicated tool works better</h2>
<p>Suggested Posts are not classic ads, so ad blockers cannot detect or remove them. LinkedIn updates their structure frequently to avoid generic filters, but dedicated tools like LinkTopics are built specifically to track and hide these patterns.</p>

<p>This means you get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A cleaner feed with less noise</li>
  <li>More visibility for important updates</li>
  <li>More control over what you see</li>
  <li>A more professional LinkedIn experience overall</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final recommendation</h2>
<p>If you're tired of Suggested Posts breaking your focus, the fastest and most reliable solution is to filter them automatically with LinkTopics. It takes less than 10 seconds to set up and keeps your LinkedIn feed relevant, clean and distraction-free.</p>
