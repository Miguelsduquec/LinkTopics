<h1>Why LinkedIn feels like Facebook now</h1>

<p>If you’ve opened LinkedIn recently and thought, “Why does this look like Facebook?”, you’re not alone. </p>
<p>In 2025, LinkedIn is pushing more viral content, personal stories, reaction-driven posts and Suggested Posts than ever before — making the feed feel less like a professional network and more like a mainstream social platform.</p>

<p>The good news: you can fix this and bring LinkedIn back to its original purpose — professional growth, learning, networking and business.</p>

<h2>Why LinkedIn feels like Facebook now</h2>

<p>LinkedIn’s algorithm has changed significantly over the last few years. Instead of prioritizing professional relevance, it now prioritizes engagement — just like Facebook, Instagram or TikTok.</p>

<p>This results in more:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal stories</strong> instead of industry insights</li>
  <li><strong>Viral emotional content</strong> instead of professional updates</li>
  <li><strong>“Liked by” posts</strong> from people you don’t follow</li>
  <li><strong>Suggested Posts</strong> based on trending topics</li>
  <li><strong>Ads and promotions</strong> buried between regular posts</li>
</ul>

<p>LinkedIn does this because emotional content generates more reactions, shares and comments — which means more time on platform.</p>

<h2>The problem with a Facebook-style LinkedIn feed</h2>

<p>For casual browsing, this might not seem like a big deal. But for professionals who depend on LinkedIn for career or business, this shift brings real problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lower productivity:</strong> more irrelevant content means more wasted time.</li>
  <li><strong>Less learning:</strong> great niche insights get buried under viral noise.</li>
  <li><strong>Harder networking:</strong> professional posts get less visibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Brand dilution:</strong> the platform feels less credible and serious.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use LinkedIn for growth, job opportunities, visibility or sales — a clean feed is essential.</p>

<h2>How to fix your LinkedIn feed</h2>

<h3>1. Clean your follow list</h3>
<p>If you follow too many accounts, the algorithm floods your feed with mixed content. Review and unfollow anything that’s no longer relevant.</p>

<h3>2. Hide low-quality posts manually</h3>
<p>You can hide individual posts by clicking the three dots (…). But this only helps temporarily — LinkedIn will continue showing similar content.</p>

<h3>3. Turn off unnecessary notifications</h3>
<p>Some notifications automatically create feed items, adding more noise. Disable activity types you don’t care about.</p>

<h3>4. Automatically filter the feed with a browser extension</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to “de-Facebook” your LinkedIn feed is to hide the content categories that make LinkedIn feel like a social media platform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suggested Posts</li>
  <li>Reaction-based “Liked by” posts</li>
  <li>Sensational viral threads</li>
  <li>Sponsored and promoted ads</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> is one of the most effective tools for this. It cleans your feed in real time and removes the types of posts that turn LinkedIn into Facebook.</p>

<h2>What your feed looks like after cleaning</h2>

<p>Once you filter out the algorithm-driven noise, your LinkedIn feed becomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Focused</strong> — only relevant updates and industry insights</li>
  <li><strong>Professional</strong> — less emotional content, more value</li>
  <li><strong>Efficient</strong> — less scrolling, more learning</li>
  <li><strong>Predictable</strong> — based on who you follow, not random posts</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, LinkedIn feels like LinkedIn again.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>LinkedIn is at its best when it provides learning, career opportunities and meaningful professional connections — not when it imitates Facebook. With a few adjustments and the right tools, you can restore your feed to its professional purpose and make the platform useful again.</p>
