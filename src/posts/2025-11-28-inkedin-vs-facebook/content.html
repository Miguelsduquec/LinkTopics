        <h1>Why LinkedIn feels like Facebook now</h1>
        <p>If your LinkedIn feed suddenly feels emotional, viral or chaotic, there’s a reason — and a way to fix it fast.</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>Many users report that LinkedIn now looks more like Facebook than a professional network. That's because the platform pushes viral content, personal stories, “Liked by” posts and Suggested Posts — anything that boosts engagement. If you want a clean, focused feed again, this guide explains how.</p>
        <p>If your main frustration is ads and sponsored posts, check our guide on <a href="/blog/hide-linkedin-ads">how to hide LinkedIn ads effectively</a>.</p>

        <h2>Why LinkedIn feels like Facebook now</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn’s algorithm has shifted toward engagement-first content — similar to Facebook or Instagram. Instead of prioritizing professional relevance, the system boosts posts that trigger emotions, reactions and shares.</p>

        <p>This leads to more:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal stories</strong> instead of industry insights</li>
          <li><strong>Viral emotional posts</strong> instead of professional updates</li>
          <li><strong>“Liked by” posts</strong> from people you don’t follow</li>
          <li><strong>Suggested Posts</strong> based on trends instead of relevance</li>
          <li><strong>Ads</strong> placed between organic posts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Engagement-driven content keeps users scrolling — but hurts productivity and relevance.</p>

        <h2>The problem with a Facebook-style LinkedIn feed</h2>

        <p>For a social platform, emotional content is fine. But for LinkedIn, it creates friction for anyone using the platform professionally.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lower productivity</strong> — constant noise wastes time.</li>
          <li><strong>Less learning</strong> — industry insights get buried.</li>
          <li><strong>Harder networking</strong> — professional posts lose visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Brand dilution</strong> — LinkedIn feels less serious.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you rely on LinkedIn for business, hiring or personal branding, a clean, predictable feed is essential.</p>

        <h2>How to fix your LinkedIn feed</h2>

        <h3>1. Clean your follow list</h3>
        <p>Unfollow accounts that no longer match your interests. This helps LinkedIn prioritize relevant updates.</p>

        <h3>2. Hide low-quality posts manually</h3>
        <p>Use the three-dot menu to hide individual posts — but note this is temporary.</p>

        <h3>3. Turn off unnecessary notifications</h3>
        <p>Many notifications create feed clutter. Disable ones that aren’t valuable.</p>

        <h3>4. Automatically clean the feed with a browser extension</h3>
        <p>The fastest way to “de-Facebook” LinkedIn is with a tool that hides the categories causing the mess:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Suggested Posts</li>
          <li>“Liked by” posts</li>
          <li>Viral engagement threads</li>
          <li>Sponsored ads</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> is one of the most effective tools for this. It filters the feed in real time and removes engagement-driven noise automatically.</p>

        <h2>What your feed looks like after cleaning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Focused</strong> — only relevant updates appear</li>
          <li><strong>Professional</strong> — less emotional content</li>
          <li><strong>Efficient</strong> — less scrolling, more value</li>
          <li><strong>Predictable</strong> — driven by who you follow, not trends</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A clean feed restores LinkedIn to what it was meant to be: a place for learning, opportunity and meaningful professional relationships.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn works best when your feed supports your goals — not when it imitates Facebook. With a few simple adjustments and the right tools, you can restore a professional, calm and useful experience.</p>
