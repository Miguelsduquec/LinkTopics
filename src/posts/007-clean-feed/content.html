<p>If your LinkedIn feed feels overwhelming, noisy, or filled with content you never asked to see, you’re not alone. Between ads, Suggested Posts, and random “Liked by” updates, the platform can easily turn into a distraction instead of a professional tool. The good news: with a few simple steps, you can clean your LinkedIn feed and make it focused, useful, and aligned with your career goals.</p>

<h2>Why your LinkedIn feed feels messy in 2025</h2>
<p>The LinkedIn algorithm is built to maximize engagement — not productivity. That’s why your feed includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sponsored posts</li>
  <li>Suggested Posts (“Trending now”, “Because you follow…”)</li>
  <li>Posts someone in your network liked or reacted to</li>
  <li>Viral content from people you don’t follow</li>
  <li>Content based on trending topics, not relevance</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this creates noise that pushes important professional content down your feed.</p>

<h2>Step 1 — Unfollow accounts that don’t bring value</h2>
<p>Many users follow hundreds of accounts without realizing it. Cleaning these up helps reduce irrelevant posts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit your LinkedIn homepage.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>“My Network”</strong> → <strong>“Connections”</strong>.</li>
  <li>Review who or what you follow and unfollow accounts that no longer match your interests.</li>
</ol>

<p>This won’t remove ads or Suggested Posts, but it helps surface more relevant updates.</p>

<h2>Step 2 — Hide content you don’t want to see</h2>
<p>For individual posts, LinkedIn allows you to remove them manually:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the three dots (…) on the top right of a post.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>“I don't want to see this”</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose the appropriate reason.</li>
</ol>

<p>This hides the post, but only temporarily — LinkedIn will still show similar types of content later.</p>

<h2>Step 3 — Turn off notifications that create feed clutter</h2>
<p>Some notifications automatically create posts in your feed. You can disable these by going to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Settings & Privacy</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Notifications</strong></li>
  <li>Disable updates you don’t want appearing in your feed</li>
</ol>

<p>This can reduce noise, especially from automated alerts and network updates.</p>

<h2>Step 4 — Automatically remove ads, Suggested Posts and reaction posts</h2>
<p>The fastest way to make your feed clean and professional is to automatically filter out the content you don’t want. Tools like <strong>LinkTopics</strong> remove:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sponsored and Promoted ads</li>
  <li>Suggested Posts</li>
  <li>“Liked by” and reaction posts</li>
  <li>Trending recommendations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why a clean feed matters</h2>
<p>A cleaner, more professional LinkedIn feed brings real benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>More relevant content:</strong> see updates from people and companies you care about.</li>
  <li><strong>Less stress:</strong> fewer distractions and less scrolling.</li>
  <li><strong>Better opportunities:</strong> important posts become more visible.</li>
  <li><strong>More productivity:</strong> use LinkedIn as a work tool instead of a feed full of noise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>LinkedIn is one of the most powerful platforms for networking, professional growth, business, and learning — but only if your feed works for you.</p>

<p>By cleaning up your follow list, hiding unhelpful posts, reducing notifications, and using smart tools like LinkTopics, you can transform your feed into something useful, calm, and achievement-oriented.</p>
