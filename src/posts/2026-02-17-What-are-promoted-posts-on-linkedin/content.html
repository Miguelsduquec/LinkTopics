  <h1>What Are Promoted Posts on LinkedIn and Why You See So Many</h1>
  <p><em>How promoted posts work, why they blend in, and what control users actually have.</em></p>
</header>

<section>
  <p>If you scroll through LinkedIn regularly, you’ve likely noticed posts that feel like recommendations — but aren’t.</p>

  <p>They don’t come from people you follow, yet they appear naturally in your feed.</p>

  <p>These are promoted posts.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Exactly Is a Promoted Post?</h2>

  <p>A promoted post is paid content distributed directly into the LinkedIn feed.</p>

  <p>Unlike traditional ads, promoted posts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use the same layout as organic posts,</li>
    <li>appear between regular updates,</li>
    <li>are labeled subtly as “Promoted”.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Why Promoted Posts Blend Into the Feed</h2>

  <p>LinkedIn intentionally minimizes the visual difference between promoted and organic posts.</p>

  <p>This allows promoted content to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>benefit from normal scrolling behavior,</li>
    <li>feel like recommendations instead of ads,</li>
    <li>capture attention without interruption.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Why You’re Seeing More Promoted Posts Than Before</h2>

  <p>The growth of promoted posts is driven by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>increased advertiser demand,</li>
    <li>strong performance of feed-based ads,</li>
    <li>longer average LinkedIn sessions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As LinkedIn grows, promoted content scales with it.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Manual Hiding Doesn’t Work Long Term</h2>

  <p>Each promoted post belongs to a different campaign.</p>

  <p>Hiding one does not reduce the next.</p>

  <p>This creates a constant cleanup loop, similar to what’s described in:

<section>
  <h2>How LinkTopics Fits In</h2>

  <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> removes promoted posts automatically.</p>

  <p>Instead of reacting to each ad, users can keep their feed focused on organic content by default.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Promoted posts are designed to feel natural — that’s why they’re effective.</p>

  <p>Understanding their role explains why the feed often feels noisy.</p>

  <p><strong>Reducing promoted content requires more than LinkedIn’s native controls.</strong></p>
