<h1>Switching From a Generic Ad Blocker to LinkTopics</h1>

<p>If you already use a generic ad blocker like AdBlock or uBlock, you might be wondering if LinkTopics is really necessary.</p>
  <p>The short answer: if LinkedIn is an important part of your work, a specialised tool will almost always give you a better experience.</p>


<p>This guide shows how to switch from a generic ad blocker to <strong>LinkTopics</strong> in a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>1. Understand what your current ad blocker does — and doesn’t do</h2>
<p>Ad blockers are designed for banners, pop-ups and tracking scripts across the entire web. On LinkedIn, they may remove some ad assets, but they usually:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not reliably remove native Sponsored posts</li>
  <li>Do not touch Suggested Posts</li>
  <li>Do not remove reaction-based “Liked by” content</li>
  <li>Sometimes break parts of the UI when LinkedIn changes code</li>
</ul>

<p>LinkTopics is focused solely on LinkedIn, so it can be more precise and stable.</p>

<h2>2. Install LinkTopics alongside your existing ad blocker</h2>
<p>You don’t need to uninstall your current blocker. Simply:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install LinkTopics from the Chrome Web Store.</li>
  <li>Open LinkedIn and refresh the page.</li>
  <li>Check the feed and see which posts are still slipping through.</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Configure LinkTopics to handle what your ad blocker misses</h2>
<p>Inside the LinkTopics popup, enable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hide Sponsored / Promoted posts</li>
  <li>Hide Suggested Posts</li>
  <li>Hide “Liked by” and reaction-based posts</li>
</ul>

<p>Your generic blocker can keep handling banners and trackers on other websites, while LinkTopics handles the specific noise inside LinkedIn.</p>

<h2>4. Monitor for a week and adjust</h2>
<p>Use LinkedIn normally for a week and observe your feed. If something useful is being hidden, you can always toggle options in LinkTopics or briefly pause it.</p>

<h2>5. Enjoy a cleaner, more stable experience</h2>
<p>Instead of relying on a one-size-fits-all blocker, you now have a LinkedIn-specific solution that knows exactly what to filter – making your daily workflow smoother and more predictable.</p>
