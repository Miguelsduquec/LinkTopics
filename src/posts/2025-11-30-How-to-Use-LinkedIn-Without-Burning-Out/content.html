  <h1>How to use LinkedIn without burning out</h1>
  <p>LinkedIn can be a powerful career tool — or a constant source of distraction. The difference comes down to how intentionally you use it and how much noise you allow into your feed.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <p>Most people open LinkedIn “just for a minute” and end up scrolling through ads, Suggested Posts and reaction-based content they never asked to see. That's how LinkedIn burnout happens.</p>
  <p>This guide shows how to protect your focus, reduce digital fatigue, and use LinkedIn in a calm, intentional way.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>1. Decide what LinkedIn is actually for</h2>
  <p>Burnout usually comes from using LinkedIn for everything — news, networking, entertainment, validation, learning — all at once. Pick one or two main goals, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Finding clients or opportunities</li>
    <li>Building authority in your niche</li>
    <li>Learning from experts and leaders</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once your goal is clear, most content becomes easier to ignore.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Reduce noise in your feed</h2>
  <p>Feed fatigue is caused by cognitive overload. Sponsored posts, Suggested Posts and “Liked by” updates take up mental space even when you don’t engage with them.</p>
  <p>Start by cleaning your follow list and hiding irrelevant posts. Then automate the rest.</p>

  <p><strong>The fastest way to reduce noise:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unfollow accounts that no longer align with your goals.</li>
    <li>Use the “I don't want to see this” option for low-quality posts.</li>
    <li>Follow only high-signal creators and topics.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To go further, use a dedicated tool like <strong>LinkTopics</strong> to automatically remove:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sponsored and Promoted posts</li>
    <li>Suggested Posts (“Trending now”, “Because you follow…”) </li>
    <li>“Liked by” and reaction-based posts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Set strict time boundaries</h2>
  <p>LinkedIn is overwhelming when it's always open. Treat it like a meeting, not background noise.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Morning (10–15 min):</strong> reply, comment, post.</li>
    <li><strong>Afternoon (10 min):</strong> follow up and review important updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Close the tab when you're done. Intentional sessions beat endless micro-scrolling.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Create instead of endlessly consuming</h2>
  <p>Consumption drains energy; creation builds momentum. Try posting small, useful insights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lessons from recent work</li>
    <li>Quick tips in your industry</li>
    <li>Thoughtful comments on expert posts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This shifts LinkedIn from something that drains you to something that compounds over time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Protect your mental space</h2>
  <p>If a type of content consistently annoys, stresses or distracts you — remove it. Hide, unfollow or filter it out entirely.</p>
  <p>Your feed should feel focused and energising, not chaotic.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
  <p>LinkedIn doesn’t have to feel like another addictive social feed. With clear goals, intentional habits and a clean, quiet feed, it becomes one of the most valuable tools for your career.</p>
  <p>Use it deliberately — and let automation handle the rest.</p>
