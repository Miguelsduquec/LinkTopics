        <h1>Remove “Liked by” Posts</h1>
        <p>LinkedIn keeps showing posts just because someone liked them — even if they have nothing to do with you. Here’s how to remove them for good.</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>In 2026, LinkedIn aggressively boosts posts that someone in your network interacts with — even when the content is irrelevant. These “Liked by” and “Reacted by” posts clutter your feed, bury useful updates, and make LinkedIn feel more like a social feed than a professional tool.</p>

        <p>In this guide, you’ll learn why LinkedIn forces these posts on you, why native options don’t solve the problem, and the fastest way to clean your feed.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Why You Keep Seeing “Liked by” Posts</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes <strong>engagement</strong> — not relevance. When someone in your network reacts to a post:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>LinkedIn assumes you may want to see it (even if you don’t).</li>
          <li>It boosts the platform's engagement metrics.</li>
          <li>It fills your feed with content you never followed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And here’s the key problem: <strong>you cannot disable them through LinkedIn settings.</strong></p>

        <p>For more context on how LinkedIn’s feed works, independent analyses like <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hootsuite’s algorithm breakdown</a> show why these posts continue appearing.</p>

        <h2>The Fastest Way to Remove “Liked by” Posts</h2>
        <p>The only reliable method is using a LinkedIn-specific feed filtering extension such as <strong>LinkTopics</strong>.</p>

        <p>It automatically removes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Liked by” and reaction-based posts</li>
          <li>Suggested posts</li>
          <li>Sponsored and Promoted ads</li>
          <li>Other irrelevant engagement bait</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Manual Methods Don’t Work</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn allows you to hide individual posts, but:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It removes only *one* post at a time.</li>
          <li>New “Liked by” posts appear immediately.</li>
          <li>There is no global setting to disable this category.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That’s why professionals increasingly rely on automated filtering.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Benefits of Removing “Liked by” Posts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>More relevance:</strong> content from people and topics you follow.</li>
          <li><strong>Less noise:</strong> no more random personal or viral posts.</li>
          <li><strong>More focus:</strong> LinkedIn becomes a productivity tool.</li>
          <li><strong>Less scrolling:</strong> important updates surface faster.</li>
        </ul>
