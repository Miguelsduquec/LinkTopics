<p>If your LinkedIn feed is filled with posts you never asked to see — especially those annoying “Liked by” or “Reacted by” posts — you’re not alone. In 2025, LinkedIn aggressively pushes content that someone in your network interacted with, even if you don’t follow the original poster. This creates a cluttered feed full of distractions and irrelevant updates.</p>

<p>In this guide, you’ll learn exactly how to remove “Liked by” posts, why LinkedIn keeps showing them, and how to clean your feed so you only see the content that matters.</p>

<h2>Why you keep seeing “Liked by” posts on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>LinkedIn’s algorithm prioritizes engagement — not relevance. If someone in your network likes or reacts to a post, LinkedIn assumes you may also want to see it. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case.</p>

<p>“Liked by” posts clutter your feed because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are cheap engagement boosters for LinkedIn’s algorithm.</li>
  <li>They make the platform feel more active (even if the content is irrelevant).</li>
  <li>You cannot disable them from LinkedIn’s built-in settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly: hiding them manually doesn’t stop them from appearing again.</p>

<h2>The fastest way to remove “Liked by” posts</h2>
<p>The only effective and automatic way to hide “Liked by” posts is by using a browser extension specifically designed for LinkedIn feed filtering. One of the most reliable tools is <strong>LinkTopics</strong>, which automatically removes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Liked by” posts</li>
  <li>Reaction-based posts</li>
  <li>Suggested posts</li>
  <li>Sponsored and Promoted ads</li>
</ul>

<p>You can install it here:</p>

👉 Install LinkTopics for free on the Chrome Web Store
</a></p>

<h2>How to remove “Liked by” posts with LinkTopics</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Install LinkTopics from the Chrome Web Store.</li>
  <li>Open LinkedIn and refresh your feed.</li>
  <li>Click the LinkTopics icon in your Chrome toolbar.</li>
  <li>Toggle on the option: <strong>Hide Liked/Reactions</strong>.</li>
  <li>Scroll through your feed and enjoy a cleaner, more focused experience.</li>
</ol>

<p>The extension works by removing the entire post container as soon as it detects a “Liked by” pattern, keeping your feed professional and distraction-free.</p>

<h2>Why manual methods don’t work</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, LinkedIn does not offer any native setting to disable “Liked by” posts. You can click the three dots on a post and select “Not interested”, but this only hides that <em>single</em> post — not the entire category.</p>

<p>Manually hiding posts also has problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s time-consuming.</li>
  <li>The feed repopulates with new “Liked by” posts instantly.</li>
  <li>There is no “global off” switch.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s why professionals, recruiters and managers increasingly rely on dedicated filtering tools.</p>

<h2>The benefits of removing “Liked by” posts</h2>
<p>Cleaning your feed isn’t just about aesthetics — it brings real productivity improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>More relevance:</strong> you only see content from people and topics you follow.</li>
  <li><strong>Less noise:</strong> no more personal updates or viral posts you don’t care about.</li>
  <li><strong>More focus:</strong> your feed becomes a tool, not a distraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Less scrolling:</strong> important content surfaces faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>LinkedIn becomes useful again — not a flood of random engagement bait.</p>

<h2>Final recommendation</h2>
<p>If you want to completely remove “Liked by” posts on LinkedIn in 2025, the most effective solution is to use a filtering tool such as LinkTopics. It cleans your feed in real time and hides everything that doesn’t serve your professional goals.</p>
