        <h1>Why Your LinkedIn Feed Feels Messy</h1>
        <p>If your LinkedIn feed feels noisy, random or full of posts you never asked to see, you’re not imagining it. The algorithm is optimised for engagement, not for your focus — but you can take control again.</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <img
          src="./thumbnail.jpeg"
          alt="Illustration showing a LinkedIn feed being cleaned and reorganized for a more professional experience"
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <p>The LinkedIn feed has slowly turned into a mix of ads, Suggested Posts and random “Liked by” updates from your network. Left as-is, it behaves more like a social network designed for endless scrolling than a serious work tool.</p>
        <p>In this guide, you’ll learn why your LinkedIn feed feels messy, which native settings actually help, and how to use a dedicated feed cleaner to remove the worst noise automatically.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why your LinkedIn feed feels messy</h2>
        <p>The LinkedIn algorithm is built to maximise engagement — not productivity or depth. That’s why your feed often includes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sponsored posts and subtle ads</li>
          <li>Suggested Posts (“Trending now”, “Because you follow…”, “People are talking about…”)</li>
          <li>Posts someone in your network liked or reacted to</li>
          <li>Viral content from people you don’t follow</li>
          <li>Content based on trending topics, not your actual needs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All of this creates noise that pushes important professional content down your feed, making LinkedIn feel chaotic instead of focused.</p>

        <p>If you want a more technical look at how the algorithm behaves, you can read breakdowns like <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-algorithm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hootsuite’s guide to the LinkedIn algorithm</a> or LinkedIn’s own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a507663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official help article on feed preferences</a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 1 — Unfollow accounts that don’t bring value</h2>
        <p>Many users follow hundreds of people, pages and newsletters that no longer match their interests. Cleaning this up reduces irrelevant posts at the source.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Visit your LinkedIn homepage.</li>
          <li>Click <strong>“My Network”</strong> → <strong>“Connections”</strong>.</li>
          <li>Review who and what you follow, and unfollow accounts that no longer bring value.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This won’t remove ads or Suggested Posts, but it helps surface more relevant updates from people and companies you actually care about.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 2 — Hide content you don’t want to see</h2>
        <p>For individual posts, LinkedIn allows you to hide them manually. This sends a weak signal to the algorithm about what you dislike.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Click the three dots (…) on the top right of a post.</li>
          <li>Select <strong>“I don't want to see this”</strong>.</li>
          <li>Choose the appropriate reason.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This hides the post, but only temporarily — LinkedIn will still show similar types of content later, especially Sponsored and Suggested posts that behave like native feed items.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 3 — Turn off notifications that create feed clutter</h2>
        <p>Some notifications automatically create posts and updates in your feed. You can disable these to reduce noise from automated alerts and engagement events.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open <strong>Settings &amp; Privacy</strong> on LinkedIn.</li>
          <li>Go to <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li>
          <li>Turn off updates you don’t want appearing in your feed (for example, automatic reactions, birthdays or minor network changes).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This won’t fix the algorithm, but it does reduce the amount of low-value content that appears just because you’re connected to a large network.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 4 — Automatically remove ads, Suggested Posts and reaction posts</h2>
        <p>The fastest way to make your feed clean and professional is to automatically filter out the content you don’t want. A dedicated LinkedIn feed cleaner like <strong>LinkTopics</strong> works at the feed level inside your browser, instead of relying on LinkedIn’s limited settings.</p>

        <p>With LinkTopics, you can automatically hide:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sponsored and Promoted ads in the main feed</li>
          <li>Suggested Posts (“Trending now”, “Because you follow…”, “People are talking about…”)</li>
          <li>“Liked by” and reaction-based posts from strangers</li>
          <li>Other viral clutter that doesn’t serve your professional goals</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many people search for a generic <strong>“linkedin adblock”</strong> extension hoping it will remove this noise. The problem is that most ad blockers only target classic banners and scripts, while LinkedIn uses native feed items. A LinkedIn-specific tool like LinkTopics is designed for this exact scenario.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Why generic “linkedin adblock” extensions fall short</h2>
        <p>Browser-wide ad blockers such as AdBlock or uBlock Origin are great for blocking pop-ups and banner ads, but LinkedIn ads are different. They appear as regular feed posts with subtle visual labels like “Promoted” or “Sponsored”.</p>

        <p>This means a generic <strong>linkedin adblock</strong> setup often:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Misses native Sponsored posts entirely</li>
          <li>Breaks parts of the LinkedIn layout when rules are too aggressive</li>
          <li>Does nothing about Suggested Posts or “Liked by” clutter</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Because LinkTopics is built specifically for LinkedIn’s DOM and patterns, it can hide these native elements much more reliably than a generic ad blocker.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why a clean feed matters</h2>
        <p>A cleaner, more professional LinkedIn feed brings real benefits beyond “looking nicer”. It directly affects how you use the platform and what you get from it.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>More relevant content:</strong> you see updates from people, companies and topics that actually matter.</li>
          <li><strong>Less stress:</strong> fewer distractions and less doom-scrolling through random posts.</li>
          <li><strong>Better opportunities:</strong> important announcements, roles and conversations are less likely to be buried.</li>
          <li><strong>More productivity:</strong> LinkedIn becomes a work tool instead of a background social feed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When ads, Suggested Posts and reaction-based clutter are under control, LinkedIn feels closer to what it was meant to be: a professional network, not just another social timeline.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn is still one of the most powerful platforms for networking, professional growth, business and learning — but only if your feed works <em>for</em> you instead of against you.</p>

        <p>By cleaning up your follow list, hiding unhelpful posts, reducing noisy notifications and using a LinkedIn-specific feed filter like LinkTopics, you can transform your feed into something useful, calm and aligned with your goals.</p>

        <h2>FAQ — Cleaning a messy LinkedIn feed</h2>

        <h3>Why does my LinkedIn feed feel so messy?</h3>
        <p>Your feed feels messy because LinkedIn mixes Sponsored posts, Suggested Posts, viral content and “Liked by” updates with the posts you actually care about. The algorithm is designed to maximise engagement, not reduce distractions.</p>

        <h3>Can I fix my LinkedIn feed using settings only?</h3>
        <p>You can improve things a little by unfollowing accounts, hiding individual posts and turning off noisy notifications. However, LinkedIn does not offer a global setting to disable all ads, Suggested Posts or “Liked by” clutter.</p>

        <h3>Do generic linkedin adblock extensions remove LinkedIn ads?</h3>
        <p>Most generic ad blockers struggle with LinkedIn because the ads are native feed items, not classic banners. They may block some assets but usually do not fully remove Sponsored posts or Suggested Posts from the feed.</p>

        <h3>How does LinkTopics help clean my feed?</h3>
        <p>LinkTopics is a Chrome extension built specifically for LinkedIn. It detects Sponsored posts, Suggested Posts and “Liked by” content in your feed and hides them automatically, so you can focus on real professional updates.</p>

        <h3>Is it worth the effort to clean my LinkedIn feed?</h3>
        <p>Yes. A clean feed makes LinkedIn feel calmer, more focused and much more useful. Instead of wasting time scrolling past noise, you can act on relevant information, spot real opportunities and use the platform intentionally.</p>
