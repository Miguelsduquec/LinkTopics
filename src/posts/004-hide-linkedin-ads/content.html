<p>If you're tired of scrolling through LinkedIn and seeing more ads than real content, you're not alone. In 2025, the LinkedIn feed is packed with Promoted posts, Sponsored content and random Suggested posts that feel more like Facebook than a professional network. The good news: you can hide most of this noise and get your focus back.</p>

<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>LinkedIn shows more Sponsored and Suggested posts than ever, which hurts focus and productivity.</li>
  <li>Built-in LinkedIn options only hide individual ads, they do not remove ads from your feed permanently.</li>
  <li>Generic ad blockers struggle with LinkedIn because most ads are “native” feed posts, not classic banners.</li>
  <li>Using a LinkedIn-focused Chrome extension such as <strong>LinkTopics</strong> is the easiest and most reliable way to hide ads, Suggested posts and “Liked by” clutter.</li>
  <li>A cleaner feed means more time for real professional content, networking and opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why LinkedIn shows so many ads in 2025</h2>
<p>Over the last years LinkedIn became one of the most profitable advertising platforms in the world. Recruiters, B2B marketers and sales teams all compete for attention inside the same feed where you try to learn, network and stay updated.</p>
<p>To maximise revenue, LinkedIn pushes more Sponsored and Suggested posts into your timeline. As a result, a significant portion of what you see every day is not content you chose to follow, but content that paid to appear there.</p>

<h2>The problem with a noisy LinkedIn feed</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Less control:</strong> you see fewer posts from people and companies you actually follow.</li>
  <li><strong>More distractions:</strong> you lose time scrolling past ads, promotions and irrelevant discussions.</li>
  <li><strong>Lower signal-to-noise:</strong> important professional updates get buried under engagement bait.</li>
  <li><strong>Mental fatigue:</strong> constant irrelevant stimuli make it harder to focus on what truly matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>If LinkedIn is part of your workday, this noise has a real cost. Cleaning up your feed is not just about aesthetics, it is about <em>productivity and decision-making</em>.</p>

<h2>Method 1 – Hide LinkedIn ads with LinkTopics (recommended)</h2>
<p>The most effective way to hide LinkedIn ads in 2025 is to use a browser extension specifically designed for LinkedIn. <strong>LinkTopics</strong> is a lightweight Chrome extension that filters your feed directly in the browser, without touching your account or your data.</p>

<h3>What LinkTopics can hide</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sponsored and Promoted posts in the main feed.</li>
  <li>Suggested posts such as “Because you follow…” or “Trending now”.</li>
  <li>“Liked by” posts that appear just because someone in your network reacted to them.</li>
  <li>Other non-work related clutter that breaks your focus.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What LinkTopics does <em>not</em> do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It does not post or comment on your behalf.</li>
  <li>It does not change your LinkedIn account or settings.</li>
  <li>It does not send your data to external servers – filtering happens locally in your browser.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to set it up</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Install LinkTopics from the Chrome Web Store:<br />

    </a>
  </li>
  <li>Open LinkedIn and refresh the page so the extension can start filtering your feed.</li>
  <li>Click the LinkTopics icon in your browser toolbar to open the popup.</li>
  <li>Toggle the options you want: hide Ads, hide Suggested posts, hide “Liked by” posts, and more.</li>
  <li>Scroll your feed and enjoy a much cleaner, more professional experience.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Before and after using LinkTopics</h2>
<p>Here is what most users notice after enabling LinkTopics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sponsored and Promoted posts disappear from the feed.</li>
  <li>Suggested posts and random viral content are heavily reduced.</li>
  <li>The feed feels calmer, more focused and far more “professional”.</li>
  <li>Posts from people and companies you actually care about become more visible.</li>
  <li>You spend less time scrolling and more time acting on relevant information.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practical terms, this means less frustration and more value every time you open LinkedIn.</p>

<h2>Method 2 – Hiding individual ads with LinkedIn’s own options</h2>
<p>LinkedIn does provide a basic way to hide specific ads. If you click on the three dots in the corner of a Sponsored post, you can choose options like “I don’t want to see this ad”. This can be useful when a particular ad is annoying or completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>However, this method has serious limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It hides only <em>one</em> ad at a time.</li>
  <li>New ads will continue to appear in the same place.</li>
  <li>You cannot turn off Sponsored posts globally.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, this is a temporary band-aid, not a real solution. If you seriously want fewer ads, you need something that works at the feed level – not just post by post.</p>

<h2>Method 3 – Using generic ad blockers (partial solution)</h2>
<p>Browser extensions like AdBlock, uBlock Origin or AdGuard are great for blocking classic web ads such as banners and pop-ups. Unfortunately, LinkedIn uses mainly <em>native</em> ads, which look almost identical to normal posts.</p>
<p>Because of this, generic ad blockers often struggle to remove Sponsored posts reliably. They might block some assets but still leave the actual ad container in the feed, or they break parts of the layout when LinkedIn updates its HTML structure.</p>
<p>They also do nothing about “Liked by” posts or Suggested posts – two of the biggest sources of noise on LinkedIn today.</p>

<h2>Why a LinkedIn-focused extension works better</h2>
<p>A dedicated filtering extension like LinkTopics is built specifically around LinkedIn’s DOM structure and patterns. Instead of trying to block ad servers in general, it understands how LinkedIn labels Sponsored content, Suggested posts and reaction-based posts, and hides them at the right level.</p>
<p>This is why LinkTopics can hide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sponsored posts in the feed, even when their markup changes over time.</li>
  <li>“Because you follow…” and other Suggested sections.</li>
  <li>Posts that appear only because someone in your network pressed Like or reacted with an emoji.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final thoughts: make LinkedIn useful again</h2>
<p>LinkedIn is still one of the best platforms for professional networking, job opportunities and B2B growth – but only if your feed works <em>for</em> you instead of against you. Hiding ads, Suggested posts and “Liked by” clutter is one of the simplest ways to turn LinkedIn back into a serious tool.</p>
<p>If you want a faster, quieter and more focused LinkedIn experience, try LinkTopics on your next browsing session:</p>
