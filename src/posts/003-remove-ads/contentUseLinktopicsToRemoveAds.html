<p>Linkedin is a great place to connect with others in your field, but it can get pretty noisy. Between all the Linkedin Ads, endless job posts, and everyone liking random stuff, your feed fills up fast. It’s easy to lose track of what you actually care about. That’s where Linktopics comes in. It helps you clean up your feed, get rid of the clutter, and focus on the topics that matter to you. If you’re tired of scrolling past ads and irrelevant posts, this tool might make your Linkedin experience a lot better.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li><p>Linktopics filters out Linkedin Ads, job posts, and likes, making your feed cleaner.</p></li><li><p>You can set up custom filters to only see topics that interest you.</p></li><li><p>The tool lets you ignore or hide posts, groups, and threads you don’t want to see.</p></li><li><p>Tag-based filtering helps you keep up with the discussions that matter most to you.</p></li><li><p>You’ll spend less time wading through clutter and more time on real, useful conversations.</p></li></ul><h2>Understanding the Impact of Linkedin Ads on Content Discovery</h2><img src="https://contenu.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/e0abeda0-dff3-45f5-9a13-9eaf2dd1e726/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Person removing ads and highlighting topics on LinkedIn"><h3>How Linkedin Ads Influence Your Feed</h3><p>If you’ve opened Linkedin recently, chances are the first thing you noticed wasn’t from someone you know—it was an ad. <strong>Ads on Linkedin don't just appear on the side; they break right into your main feed, popping up between posts from people you actually care about.</strong> This constant flow of sponsored content makes it way harder to spot posts and conversations that matter to you. It’s not only advertisements for courses, conferences, or high-priced software—sometimes it feels like every third post is marked as "Promoted."</p><h3>Identifying the Noise Created by Job Posts and Likes</h3><p>Job posts and “likes” add another layer of noise. <em>Every time someone in your network likes or comments on a random post or job ad, it can jump up into your feed, even if you have no real interest in that topic or opening.</em> Here’s what usually clutters your homepage:</p><ul><li><p>Job vacancy posts unrelated to your field</p></li><li><p>Posts receiving lots of likes but containing no new info</p></li><li><p>Generic inspirational quotes with hundreds of reactions</p></li></ul><table style="min-width: 75px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Type of Noise</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Frequency on Feed</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Personal Relevance</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ads</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Very High</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Usually Low</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Job Posts</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>High</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Often Low</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Liked/Commented Posts</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Medium-High</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Varies</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Challenges of Staying Focused on Relevant Topics</h3><p>Staying focused gets tough once your feed gets flooded. Say you’re aiming to follow discussions in product management, but your feed keeps showing you sales roles or someone’s PR success story thanks to a distant connection’s like. Filtering through this stuff is time-consuming.</p><blockquote><p>Most days, it takes real effort to find posts on the topics you care about amid all the distractions. Scrolling past endless ads and random job listings just to spot one quality discussion can make networking and learning feel like chores instead of opportunities.</p></blockquote><p>With all this extra clutter, even proactive folks might give up before finding something truly useful.</p><h2>How Linktopics Helps Remove Ads and Distractions</h2><p>Scrolling through LinkedIn can feel like walking through a crowded street—there's just noise everywhere. Most of it isn't even what you came for. Here’s how Linktopics actually cuts down on the chaos so you can see what’s useful.</p><h3>Filtering Out Linkedin Ads Efficiently</h3><p><strong>Sick of seeing ads wedged between every couple of posts on LinkedIn? Linktopics gets rid of them automatically, freeing up your feed.</strong> No extra clicks, no settings to wrestle with. The tool checks every incoming post and identifies sponsored content, silently removing it so you don’t even have to think about it. Here’s what it handles:</p><ul><li><p>Detects most common ad types, including native ads and promoted job listings.</p></li><li><p>Removes them instantly from your view.</p></li><li><p>Leaves no blank space – your feed just looks cleaner and shorter.</p></li></ul><p>This isn’t just a cosmetic fix. By stripping out ads, you get a feed that’s focused on real discussion, not corporate fluff.</p><h3>Automatically Hiding Likes and Job Posts</h3><p>All those updates showing that someone you hardly know liked some post? Job announcements you’re not interested in? Linktopics can mute both instantly. You won’t see “X liked this” clutter up your topics.</p><p>A quick rundown of what’s filtered out:</p><ul><li><p>Posts made up only of likes or reactions</p></li><li><p>Job posts outside your interest area</p></li><li><p>Annoying "congrats on the new position" banners</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>After setting this up, my feed was quiet enough for me to catch up on actual group conversations for the first time in months.</p></blockquote><h3>Customizing What Content You See</h3><p>The best part about Linktopics is that you can <em>choose</em> what stays and what goes. The tool gives you toggles and filters to:</p><ul><li><p>Set personal rules for hiding content types (like hiding all polls if you want).</p></li><li><p>Create allow-lists for important job or announcements.</p></li><li><p>Whitelist contacts, groups, or keywords you always want to see—so nothing important gets missed.</p></li></ul><table style="min-width: 100px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Feature</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Ads</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Likes</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Job Posts</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Auto-Removal</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Custom Filtering</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Whitelisting</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>These controls aren’t hidden—they’re simple to set and edit anytime. So, if your mood (or your job search) changes, your feed can change with you.</p><h2>Highlighting The Topics You Care About With Linktopics</h2><p>If you've ever tried sifting through the endless scroll of LinkedIn posts, you know how much time you can lose jumping between promos, job ads, and random likes from your connections. Linktopics gives you the power to actually take control and spotlight the subjects that matter most to you.</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes, all it takes is a bit of pruning to rediscover quality content you didn't realize you'd been missing.</p></blockquote><h3>Using Tag-Based Filters for Better Relevance</h3><p>Tag-based filtering is honestly a game-changer. You get to pick out keywords or tags that really line up with your interests. Once set, Linktopics automatically highlights posts that match your selected tags and dulls out everything else.</p><p><strong>It's a relief to actually find what you're looking for without sifting through a bunch of unrelated noise.</strong></p><p>List of things you can do with tag filters:</p><ul><li><p>Select multiple tags (like "marketing," "productivity," or specific tools)</p></li><li><p>Update or remove tags anytime you want</p></li><li><p>See trending tags to discover new topics that match your focus</p></li></ul><h3>Creating Custom Views for Your Interests</h3><p>With Linktopics, you don’t get stuck with a generic, one-size-fits-all feed. Making different custom views is pretty straightforward. For example, you might want a view for just industry news, another for tech updates, and maybe one for side project inspiration. Switching between them is instant—so you can go from business mode to hobby mode in a click.</p><p>Here are some simple ways to set up your custom views:</p><ol><li><p>Choose your preferred tags or topics for each view.</p></li><li><p>Save and label each view (work, fun, local events, whatever works for you).</p></li><li><p>Switch between saved filters anytime to see just what you need, when you need it.</p></li></ol><h3>Staying Updated on High-Quality Discussions</h3><p>Not all conversations are worth your attention, and Linktopics helps you figure out which ones stand out. Instead of boosting threads just because they're popular, you see posts that are actually <em>interesting</em> based on real engagement, thoughtful comments, or your own preferences.</p><p>Here’s a quick comparison of post types that typically show up in a filtered Linktopics feed:</p><table style="min-width: 75px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Filter Setting</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Percentage of High-Quality Posts</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Noise Level</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No Filters</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>25%</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>High</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Tag Filters Only</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>55%</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Medium</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Custom View + Tags</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>80%</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Low</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's kind of amazing how much cleaner your LinkedIn feed can get once you start cutting the clutter and highlighting the subjects you actually want to read and discuss.</p><h2>Streamlining Your Linkedin Experience With Advanced Filtering</h2><p>Cleaning up your LinkedIn feed doesn't have to be complicated—Linktopics brings a bunch of advanced filters to put you back in control of what you see. It's kind of like finally getting rid of the noise you didn't even realize was bothering you. Here are a few ways these filters can really help.</p><h3>Opting Out of Unwanted Groups and Threads</h3><p>Ever get bombarded by posts from groups you joined ages ago but don't care about anymore? Linktopics makes it easy to mute entire groups or ongoing threads. It’s a real time saver and helps keep your feed on target. Here’s what you can do:</p><ul><li><p>Mute specific groups with a single click</p></li><li><p>Leave noisy threads for good</p></li><li><p>Toggle group visibility when your interests change</p></li></ul><h3>Ignoring Specific Topics Permanently</h3><p>Nobody wants to see the same boring topic day in, day out. With Linktopics, you can block any topic that just isn't useful to you. No drama, just block and move on. Example uses include blocking <em>recruitment posts</em> or endless company announcements. <strong>You’re able to shape your feed for what matters most to you.</strong></p><h3>Reducing Content Overload Effectively</h3><p>Feeling swamped with content?
