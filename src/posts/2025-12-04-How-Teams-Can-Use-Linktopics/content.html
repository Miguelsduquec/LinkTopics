<h1>How Teams Can Use LinkTopics to Standardise Their LinkedIn Experience</h1>

<p>When several people in a company rely on LinkedIn — sales reps, recruiters, founders, marketers — inconsistent feeds create inconsistent results. </p>
    <p>Some team members see endless noise, others see relevant posts, and everyone wastes time manually filtering what the algorithm throws at them.</p>


<p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> offers a simple way to standardise the LinkedIn experience across your team and keep everyone focused on what matters.</p>

<h2>1. Give everyone the same baseline: a clean feed</h2>
<p>By having your team install LinkTopics, you ensure that everyone starts from a similar, professional environment: fewer ads, fewer Suggested Posts, fewer “Liked by” distractions.</p>

<p>This is especially useful when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You’re running a coordinated campaign</li>
  <li>You want your team to focus on specific accounts or industries</li>
  <li>People are easily distracted by viral content</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Agree on which content types to hide</h2>
<p>Inside the extension, your team can align on which toggles to activate: hide ads, hide suggestions, hide reaction posts, and so on. This ensures that when you discuss “what’s happening on LinkedIn this week”, you’re not comparing totally different feeds.</p>

<h2>3. Protect deep work time</h2>
<p>If your team uses LinkedIn for prospecting, applying LinkTopics helps reduce the number of dopamine-driven distractions that compete with deep work. They can open LinkedIn, do the work and close it — instead of sliding into endless scrolling.</p>

<h2>4. Combine with a shared engagement routine</h2>
<p>Once feeds are cleaned up, you can introduce a simple team-wide routine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 minutes per day engaging with target accounts</li>
  <li>Comment policies (tone, depth, topics)</li>
  <li>Shared content calendar</li>
</ul>

<p>This turns LinkedIn into a structured, reliable channel instead of a chaotic one.</p>
