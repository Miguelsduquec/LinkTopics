        <h1>Standardise your team’s LinkedIn</h1>
        <p>When different people on your team see completely different LinkedIn feeds, it becomes harder to align on priorities, campaigns and opportunities.</p>
        <p>With LinkTopics, you can give everyone a cleaner, more focused LinkedIn experience that supports work instead of creating noise.</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>Sales reps, recruiters, founders and marketers all rely on LinkedIn, but the default feed is chaotic. Some team members see endless Suggested Posts and ads, others see “Liked by” clutter or drama threads, and everyone quietly loses time to scrolling.</p>
        <p><strong>LinkTopics</strong> offers a simple way to standardise the LinkedIn experience across the team, so people work from the same clean, professional baseline instead of fighting the algorithm on their own.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Give everyone the same clean baseline</h2>
        <p>The first step is straightforward: ask everyone who actively uses LinkedIn for work to install LinkTopics in their browser. With the default settings, the extension hides:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sponsored and Promoted posts</li>
          <li>Suggested Posts and “Trending now” sections</li>
          <li>“Liked by” and reaction-based posts that appear only because someone clicked Like</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This instantly removes a large chunk of noise and gives the team a more predictable feed. Instead of telling people to “ignore the distractions” or install random “linkedin adblock” tools, you roll out a single, consistent solution that is built specifically for LinkedIn.</p>
        <p>For a broader overview of what LinkTopics can remove from the feed, you can also share:  
          <a href="/blog/remove-ads-and-noise-on-linkedin">How to remove ads and noise on LinkedIn</a>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Align on which content types to hide</h2>
        <p>Inside the LinkTopics popup, each teammate can toggle exactly what they want to hide: ads, Suggested Posts, “Liked by” posts and more. As a manager or team lead, you can suggest a standard configuration so everyone sees broadly the same type of content.</p>
        <p>For example, a typical team baseline might be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hide Sponsored/Promoted posts:</strong> reduces ad-driven distractions.</li>
          <li><strong>Hide Suggested Posts:</strong> removes “Because you follow…” and “People are talking about…” sections.</li>
          <li><strong>Hide “Liked by” posts:</strong> keeps your feed focused on accounts you intentionally follow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This makes conversations like “What’s working on LinkedIn this week?” or “Which posts are our prospects seeing?” far easier, because everyone is working from a similar, filtered feed instead of comparing completely different timelines.</p>

        <h2>3. Protect deep work and prospecting time</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn can easily interrupt deep work. A quick check “just to see what’s happening” often turns into ten minutes of scrolling through Suggested Posts and reaction bait. For sales and recruiting teams, that’s lost time they could be spending on targeted outreach or pipeline work.</p>
        <p>By removing the most distracting content categories, LinkTopics helps your team:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open LinkedIn with a clear goal (prospecting, replying, publishing)</li>
          <li>See primarily relevant updates instead of viral noise</li>
          <li>Close the tab once the task is done, instead of looping through the feed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you already encourage focused time blocks or “deep work” sessions, a cleaner LinkedIn feed is a natural extension of that culture. For more on using LinkedIn productively, you can share:

        </p>
        <p>Teams that reduce context-switching and unnecessary notifications tend to execute better on campaigns and outreach.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Combine LinkTopics with a shared engagement routine</h2>
        <p>Once the feed is standardised and clean, you can introduce a simple, shared engagement routine so your team uses LinkedIn in a consistent, intentional way. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Daily 10–15 minute block</strong> to engage with target accounts or candidates</li>
          <li><strong>Comment guidelines</strong> (tone, depth, topics to focus on)</li>
          <li><strong>Shared content calendar</strong> for posts from founders, marketing and sales</li>
        </ul>
        <p>LinkTopics ensures that during that time block, people are not being pulled into random trending threads or emotionally viral posts. Instead, they see more of the accounts, industries and conversations that actually matter to your pipeline or hiring plan.</p>
        <p>To help individual team members avoid burnout while following this routine, you can also point them to:

        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Roll out LinkTopics as a simple internal “standard”</h2>
        <p>You don’t need complex documentation to roll this out. A short internal message or playbook is often enough:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who should install LinkTopics (sales, recruiting, marketing, founders)</li>
          <li>Which toggles to turn on by default</li>
          <li>How and when to use LinkedIn during the day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This small step turns LinkedIn from an unpredictable social feed into a more controlled, professional channel that supports your team’s strategy.</p>
        <p>Over time, you can refine your approach as you see what works: some teams hide almost everything except core posts; others keep Suggested Posts but aggressively remove “Liked by” clutter.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>When every team member has a different LinkedIn experience, it becomes harder to stay aligned, focused and productive. By standardising your team’s feeds with LinkTopics, you reduce noise, protect attention and make LinkedIn feel like the professional tool it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><strong>If your team uses LinkedIn for sales, recruiting or marketing, a cleaner, more predictable feed is one of the simplest upgrades you can make.</strong></p>
