  <h1>uBlock Origin for LinkedIn: Powerful Ad Blocker, Limited Feed Control</h1>
  <p><em>Updated for 2026 — why uBlock Origin blocks LinkedIn ads well, but doesn’t fully clean your LinkedIn feed.</em></p>
</header>

<section>
  <p><strong>uBlock Origin</strong> is often the first tool people install when they want to block ads — including on LinkedIn.</p>

  <p>And to be fair, it does an excellent job at that.</p>

  <p>But many users notice something strange:</p>

  <p><strong>Even with uBlock Origin enabled, the LinkedIn feed still feels noisy.</strong></p>

  <p>Let’s break down why.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Is uBlock Origin?</h2>

  <p>uBlock Origin is a free, open-source browser extension designed to block ads, trackers and unwanted network requests.</p>

  <p>It works by applying filter lists that detect known ad patterns across the web.</p>

  <p>You can learn more about how it works directly from the official project website:
    <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      https://ublockorigin.com
    </a>
  </p>

  <p>Because LinkedIn serves ads like any other website, uBlock Origin can block many of them effectively.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What uBlock Origin Does Well on LinkedIn</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blocks many sponsored posts and ads</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduces tracking scripts</strong> and network noise.</li>
    <li><strong>Highly efficient</strong> with minimal performance impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced customization</strong> for power users.</li>
    <li><strong>Free and open-source</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>From a pure ad-blocking perspective, uBlock Origin is one of the best tools available.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Your LinkedIn Feed Still Feels Noisy</h2>

  <p>Here’s the key issue:</p>

  <p><strong>LinkedIn feed noise is not just ads.</strong></p>

  <p>Even without ads, your feed still includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>posts liked or commented on by your connections,</li>
    <li>suggested posts from people you don’t follow,</li>
    <li>“Because you viewed…” recommendations,</li>
    <li>engagement-driven or viral content.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These elements are part of LinkedIn’s feed logic — not traditional ads.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Limitations of Using uBlock Origin on LinkedIn</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No understanding of feed structure</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>No way to remove “Liked by” or “Reacted by” posts</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>No topic-based filtering</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>No control over suggested content</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>No visibility</strong> into what’s removed vs what remains.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>uBlock Origin treats LinkedIn like a normal website — not a behavior-driven social feed.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>uBlock Origin vs LinkedIn Feed Cleaners</h2>

  <p>Ad blockers focus on <strong>what is served</strong>.</p>

  <p>Feed cleaners focus on <strong>what is shown</strong>.</p>

  <p>This distinction matters because LinkedIn’s algorithm shapes your feed using engagement, network activity and recommendations — not just ads.</p>

  <p>If you want to understand why this happens, see our guide on
    <a href="/blog/fix-linkedin-algorithm-2026">
      how the LinkedIn algorithm works
    </a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>uBlock Origin vs LinkTopics</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>uBlock Origin</strong> blocks ads and trackers.</li>
    <li><strong>LinkTopics</strong> cleans the LinkedIn feed itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With LinkTopics, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hide “Liked by” and reaction-based posts,</li>
    <li>remove suggested and recommended content,</li>
    <li>filter many promoted posts,</li>
    <li>choose which topics you want to see,</li>
    <li>see live counters of removed content.</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Who Should Use uBlock Origin?</h2>

  <p>uBlock Origin is ideal if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>want strong ad blocking across the entire web,</li>
    <li>are comfortable with technical tools,</li>
    <li>don’t mind feed noise beyond ads.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Who Should Use LinkTopics Instead?</h2>

  <p>LinkTopics is a better fit if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>want a calmer, more relevant LinkedIn feed,</li>
    <li>care about signal over noise,</li>
    <li>use LinkedIn daily for professional work,</li>
    <li>feel distracted even after blocking ads.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Final Verdict</h2>

  <p>uBlock Origin is an excellent ad blocker.</p>

  <p>But LinkedIn feed noise goes far beyond ads.</p>

  <p>If your goal is a truly clean, intentional LinkedIn feed, you’ll need a tool that understands how the feed itself works — not just how ads are delivered.</p>
