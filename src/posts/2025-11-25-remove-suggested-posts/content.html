        <h1>Why LinkedIn Shows Suggested Posts</h1>
        <p>LinkedIn keeps filling your feed with “Suggested Posts” and “Because you follow…” updates — here’s why they exist and how to finally hide them.</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>If your LinkedIn feed is constantly surfacing “Suggested Posts”, “Because you follow…”, or “Trending now”, you’re not imagining it. LinkedIn relies heavily on algorithm-driven content to keep you scrolling, even when those posts have very little to do with your actual work.</p>
        <p>Some suggestions can be useful, but many feel random, distracting, or closer to a social feed than a professional tool. In this guide, you’ll learn why LinkedIn pushes Suggested Posts, how to hide them manually, and the simplest way to remove them automatically so your feed stays focused.</p>

        <h2>Why LinkedIn Shows So Many Suggested Posts</h2>
        <p>Suggested Posts are LinkedIn’s way of boosting engagement. Instead of showing only content from people and companies you follow, LinkedIn injects recommendations based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Topics and hashtags you follow</li>
          <li>Pages and creators you interacted with</li>
          <li>What’s trending in your region and industry</li>
          <li>Posts with high engagement across the network</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From LinkedIn’s perspective, this keeps the feed “interesting” and increases time-on-platform. But in practice, many users experience the opposite: more noise and less control. Independent breakdowns of the <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn algorithm</a> show just how much weight these engagement signals now carry.</p>
        <p>The reality is simple: Suggested Posts exist to help LinkedIn’s metrics, not your focus or productivity.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Suggested Posts Are a Problem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>They bury real updates</strong> from people and companies you actually chose to follow.</li>
          <li><strong>They promote viral content</strong> that often has nothing to do with your professional goals.</li>
          <li><strong>They waste time</strong> by encouraging extra scrolling and reaction-driven behaviour.</li>
          <li><strong>They make your feed feel like Facebook</strong> instead of a serious business tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For anyone who uses LinkedIn to work, learn, sell or recruit, this noise has a real cost. If you want a more useful feed, you need to reduce Suggested Posts and other low-signal content as much as possible.</p>

        <h2>How to Hide Suggested Posts Manually</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn does <em>not</em> provide any global setting to turn off Suggested Posts. The only native option is to hide them one by one:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click the three dots (…) in the top-right corner of a Suggested Post.</li>
          <li>Select <strong>“I don’t want to see this”</strong>.</li>
          <li>Choose a reason such as <em>Not relevant</em> or <em>Not interested</em>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This can be helpful for a specific post, but it doesn’t solve the underlying problem. On your next refresh, LinkedIn simply injects new Suggested Posts into the same space.</p>
        <p>This behaviour is similar to what happens with Sponsored ads. Generic “linkedin adblock” extensions and classic ad blockers also struggle here, because Suggested Posts are native parts of the feed — not external ad slots.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Easiest Way to Remove Suggested Posts Automatically</h2>
        <p>The most effective way to hide Suggested Posts is to use a LinkedIn-focused browser extension that filters the feed as you scroll. One of the most reliable tools for this is <strong>LinkTopics</strong>.</p>
        <p>With LinkTopics, you can automatically hide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Suggested Posts like “Because you follow…”, “Trending now…”, and “People are talking about…”</li>
          <li>Sponsored and Promoted posts in the feed</li>
          <li>“Liked by” and reaction-based posts from strangers</li>
          <li>Other low-quality or irrelevant feed clutter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why a Dedicated Tool Works Better Than a Generic LinkedIn Adblock</h2>
        <p>Suggested Posts are not classic display ads. They are native cards inside the LinkedIn feed, which makes them difficult to block with generic ad filters or standard “linkedin adblock” extensions.</p>
        <p>LinkedIn also updates its HTML structure and CSS classes frequently. A generic blocker that relies on static rules often breaks or misses new patterns, while the Suggested Posts keep coming back.</p>
        <p>A LinkedIn-specific tool like LinkTopics is built around LinkedIn’s DOM and patterns. It understands:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How LinkedIn labels Suggested and Recommended posts</li>
          <li>Where “Because you follow…” and “Trending now” blocks appear in the feed</li>
          <li>How to safely remove those containers without breaking the rest of the UI</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Happens to Your Feed After You Remove Suggested Posts</h2>
        <p>Once Suggested Posts, Sponsored content and “Liked by” clutter are gone, most users notice the same changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your feed feels calmer and more professional.</li>
          <li>Updates from people and companies you actually follow become more visible.</li>
          <li>You spend less time scrolling and more time acting on relevant information.</li>
          <li>LinkedIn starts to feel like a work tool again, not just another social timeline.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
        <p>If you are serious about using LinkedIn for work — not endless scrolling — Suggested Posts are one of the biggest sources of noise in your feed. Hiding them one by one is slow and temporary, and generic adblockers were never designed for this job.</p>
        <p>The fastest and most reliable solution is to filter them automatically with a LinkedIn-focused extension like LinkTopics.</p>
