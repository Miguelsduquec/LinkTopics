<p>LinkedIn used to feel a lot like Facebook. People shared personal stories, some posts went viral, and it was easy to wonder if the platform was losing its professional edge. But lately, things are changing. LinkedIn is tightening up what shows up in your feed, putting knowledge first, and making sure posts actually help people at work. If you've noticed fewer viral stories and more job-focused advice, you're not imagining it. The platform is trying to be less about likes and more about learning, with Linktopics playing a big part in what gets seen and by whom.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li><p>LinkedIn's algorithm now favors helpful, work-related content over viral or personal posts.</p></li><li><p>Personal stories are still allowed, but they need to connect to professional growth or insights.</p></li><li><p>Linktopics help link your posts to the right audience, boosting relevance and authority.</p></li><li><p>Oversharing and self-promotion are less effective, as users want practical advice and real expertise.</p></li><li><p>Generational changes and remote work have shifted what’s acceptable to share, but LinkedIn is clearly moving away from Facebook-style posting.</p></li></ul><h2>The Shift Away From Virality on LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn isn’t the place to go viral anymore, and honestly, that’s by design. The platform made some quiet but huge changes to how content gets shared and seen. Back in the day, you’d spot a personal story rack up thousands of likes, but these days? Not so much. Let's see how things have shifted.</p><h3>Algorithmic Changes That Diminish Viral Posts</h3><p>LinkedIn’s team actively avoids letting posts explode across the platform. Their system isn’t chasing mass popularity—it’s built to keep things relevant and focused instead.</p><ul><li><p>The platform’s feed sorts posts with an eye toward <em>quality</em> over quantity.</p></li><li><p>Content that trends toward mass appeal or clickbait gets quietly pushed down or limited.</p></li><li><p>Viral moments are actually a warning sign for the algorithm team—they see it as not in line with LinkedIn’s purpose.</p></li></ul><p>Here’s a quick snapshot of how LinkedIn compares with typical social sites on virality:</p><table style="min-width: 75px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Platform</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Encourages Virality?</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Focus</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Facebook</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Reactions</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Twitter</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Engagement</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>LinkedIn</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Relevance</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>For more about how the system is set up, check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-algorithm/">LinkedIn’s algorithm limits virality</a>.</p><h3>Knowledge-First, Not Clickbait</h3><p><strong>Posts that actually help people in their jobs have replaced flashy, viral bait.</strong> The feed rewards contributions that are specific, useful, and tied to work or learning. Countdowns, viral memes, and thinly veiled sales pitches are seeing much less reach now.</p><ul><li><p>Knowledge sharing is the new king</p></li><li><p>Personal stories usually get filtered unless they’re tied to professional lessons</p></li><li><p>Listicles and trends for engagement’s sake are falling flat</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>There's a big difference between sharing your achievements and posting something that just grabs attention. LinkedIn now favors content that brings out real conversations on work, skills, and learning instead of noise.</p></blockquote><h3>How the Platform Polices Engagement</h3><p>LinkedIn uses a mix of algorithmic checks and user feedback to keep things in line. If a post is using engagement tricks—like tagging dozens of people, sensational headlines, or asking for likes—the system often restricts its visibility. There’s also:</p><ol><li><p>Automated detection of spammy or irrelevant posts</p></li><li><p>User reporting for off-topic content</p></li><li><p>Moderator review in cases where norms are pushed too far</p></li></ol><p>All these steps are aimed at making sure posts are meaningful and suited to <em>professional</em> conversations, not just chasing numbers.</p><p>In the end, if your aim is to break the internet with your post, LinkedIn just isn’t the spot for that anymore.</p><h2>Personal Sharing and Professional Boundaries</h2><h3>The Rise and Retreat of Vulnerability</h3><p>Over the last few years, LinkedIn saw a huge shift. People used to post only work news and job updates, but more recently, you could spot a lot of personal stories—divorces, mental health struggles, even little wins and failures from daily life. The pandemic played a big role in this. Folks were stuck at home, and suddenly, <em>work</em> and personal life blended together. Remote work made it super normal to let down your guard a little. The result? Some posts went viral as they struck a chord, and others got a fair share of heat.</p><blockquote><p>It's easy to feel encouraged seeing so many bare-all posts, but the backlash can be just as quick. Sharing about raw experiences brings a wave of support, but also leaves you open to unexpected criticism, especially when personal details cross into territory considered inappropriate for professional eyes.</p></blockquote><h3>Balancing Humanity With Expertise</h3><p>Showing, not just telling, is part of why some people thrive on LinkedIn now. A story about overcoming a workplace challenge can feel a lot more real than another bullet-pointed resume. But there's a line. Managers, recruiters, and peers still judge what lands on the right side of professional. Sharing helps remind connections there's a person behind the profile, but oversharing can make you memorable for the wrong reasons.</p><p>Sometimes it pays to keep these thoughts in mind:</p><ul><li><p>Not every story needs every detail.</p></li><li><p>Would you share this at a work meeting?</p></li><li><p>Is the point of your post clear and tied to your work life?</p></li><li><p>Does your audience gain anything from what you share?</p></li></ul><p>This balance isn't always easy, especially when everyone has different limits. Sometimes, a personal touch can help your connection requests stand out and be more effective, as personalized outreach generally gets better responses than generic ones (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.closelyhq.com/the-psychology-of-linkedin-connection-requests-data-driven-templates/">mutual connections and shared experiences</a>).</p><h3>Responding to Oversharing Concerns</h3><p>Oversharing has started to worry some people. Sometimes, when a post feels too personal, it triggers talk about bad judgment or professionalism. Hiring managers might remember more about your emotional post than your actual skills. For others, though, vulnerability is seen as a strength. There’s growing debate over where to draw the line.</p><p>Here’s a quick table showing a range of content, from personal to work-focused, and how it might be received:</p><table style="min-width: 50px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Post Type</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Typical Reaction</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Job promotion or update</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Seen as standard</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Sharing work lessons</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Often appreciated</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Mild personal struggle</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Can humanize you</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Very personal life story</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Divides opinion</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Emotional overshare</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Risk of negative view</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As the culture keeps changing, people are really figuring it out on the fly. <strong>Finding the sweet spot between relatable and too much is still a work in progress for everyone.</strong></p><h2>What Audiences Want: The Demand for Real Value</h2><img src="https://contenu.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/94b65d9b-3ff8-4361-9d3f-80b528b0edf9/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Professionals networking in a bright, modern office space."><p>These days, LinkedIn users are after more than just scrolling past endless posts. There's a real hunger for advice, firsthand knowledge, and stories that matter in their work lives. With all the changes happening on the platform, it's becoming clear: self-promotion and hollow engagement tricks are out—the platform is listening to what people actually want.</p><h3>Feedback From the LinkedIn Community</h3><ul><li><p>Users are reporting that their feeds feel more focused, less flooded with off-topic or personal content.</p></li><li><p>The number of complaints about irrelevant content dropped by 80% since the algorithm change.</p></li><li><p>People say they want insights from folks they know or from real experts in a field, not random viral content.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>There’s a noticeable shift towards posts that help you get better at your job, not just posts designed to rack up clicks. This is what keeps professionals coming back: content that feels practical, relevant, and straight to the point.</p></blockquote><h3>Rise in Demand for Career-Driven Content</h3><p>Audiences are making it clear with their engagement: practical tips and industry views are more popular than ever. The algorithm is rewarding this too, giving preference to posts that share advice, lessons learned, or real-world examples.</p><p><strong>What gets attention now?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Advice you can use right away (think, how-to’s, checklists, mistakes to avoid)</p></li><li><p>Personal lessons from experiences at work—what worked, what didn’t</p></li><li><p>Updated info about trends, tools, or hiring practices in your industry</p></li></ol><p>Here's a simple breakdown:</p><table style="min-width: 50px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Content Type</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Typical Engagement Result</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Knowledge/Advice Posts</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>High</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Generic Self-Promotion</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Low</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Personal Milestones</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Medium</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The End of Self-Promotional Content</h3><p>If you’re just posting about your own wins, product launches, or generic company news, the audience (and the algorithm) have less patience for it now. Instead, posts that start conversations or share something genuinely helpful are seeing more reach.</p><p><em>Engagement groups</em> and empty comment exchanges don't cut it anymore—real conversations with meaningful input matter more. So, anyone looking to gain traction on LinkedIn needs to shift focus to community, discussion, and knowledge-sharing.</p><ul><li><p>Avoid: Braggy posts, sales pitches, or only linking to your business</p></li><li><p>Try more: Asking for feedback or stories, sharing honest setbacks, posting a practical checklist</p></li><li><p>Reply thoughtfully to comments, making space for real discussion—people (and the algorithm) notice</p></li></ul><p>In the end, LinkedIn's audience is voting with their actions. <strong>They want posts that will actually help them work smarter, move their career forward, or simply think in a new way.</strong> If you’re not offering that, your content probably won’t go far.</p><h2>Understanding Linktopics and Post Relevance</h2><h3>Defining Linktopics for Maximum Impact</h3><p>LinkedIn doesn’t just throw every post into the same feed for everyone. Instead, the platform sorts content using something called <em>linktopics</em>—basically tags or signals about what your post is really focused on. If you post about project management, LinkedIn tries to push it toward folks who live in that world. If you write about restaurant openings, it’ll likely end up in the feeds of people who follow hospitality trends. <strong>Your content's success depends more on sharp topic definition than a catchy hook.</strong></p><p>Here’s what really matters when you’re picking and using linktopics:</p><ul><li><p>Stay in your lane—talk about subjects you know, and LinkedIn’s algorithm rewards you.</p></li><li><p>Use clear, professional keywords—avoid empty buzzwords.</p></li><li><p>Make your main subject obvious in the first few lines.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Anyone who wants their posts to get attention on LinkedIn needs to think, "Who is actually going to care about this?" Getting seen by the right folks beats going viral with the wrong crowd.</p></blockquote><h3>Getting Your Content Seen by the Right People</h3><p>It’s not just about posting often. If you want your work to reach the people who matter in your industry, you need a bit of strategy. LinkedIn now weighs the relevance of your post for a smaller, more targeted group rather than blasting it to everyone. When the platform notices active discussions or meaningful responses between subject-matter peers, it shares your post with others in similar circles.</p><p>A quick breakdown of how LinkedIn evaluates reach potential:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Author background:</strong> Are you an authority on this subject?</p></li><li><p><strong>Audience match:</strong> Does your post help a defined professional group?</p></li><li><p><strong>Conversation quality:</strong> Are responses thoughtful, or just "Nice post!" filler?</p></li></ol><p>Here’s a table showing which factors now have the biggest sway:</p><table style="min-width: 100px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Signal</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Positive Impact</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Neutral</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Negative Impact</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Authority in Topic</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Maybe</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Peer Engagement</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Maybe</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Generic Comments</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Maybe</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Clear Linktopic Chosen</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Maybe</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>No</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Authority and Topical Expertise as Ranking Factors</h3><p>LinkedIn now evaluates not just the post, but the <em>person</em> posting it. If you haven’t posted about data science before, and suddenly try to give advice on it, your reach will be pretty limited. The system looks for authors who consistently participate in certain areas—think of it like building a body of work.</p><p>So, if you:</p><ul><li><p>Stick to your usual topics, you gain traction and LinkedIn treats you as an expert.</p></li><li><p>Regularly get meaningful replies from professionals in your field, your reach grows further.</p></li><li><p>Hop between too many subjects or post outside your experience, you’ll probably see fewer people react.</p></li></ul><p>What this means: You can’t just fake your way to a huge audience anymore by jumping on whatever’s trending. LinkedIn, for better or worse, cares much more now about who’s talking—not just what’s being said.</p><h2>Generational and Cultural Shifts on the Platform</h2><p>LinkedIn isn’t just for recruiters and managers anymore. Over the last few years, the platform has changed as new generations and big global events have upended what’s considered normal for career conversations. If you scroll through your feed, you’ll notice pretty quickly that the rules of posting look different than they did even three years ago.</p><h3>Gen Z’s Influence on Sharing Norms</h3><p>Gen Z is everywhere now. If you see someone talking about a mental health struggle, walking barefoot to a meeting, or just being super open about workplace fails, chances are it’s a young professional leading the charge. For them, being honest and sharing more personal day-to-day stories feels pretty natural—which is a big shift from what older users are used to. <strong>Gen Z’s openness has changed how other age groups use LinkedIn too, sometimes pushing everyone to get real about challenges or setbacks.</strong> They aren’t worried about keeping everything buttoned up, and that’s changed the vibe on the platform.</p><h3>Evolution of Professional Etiquette</h3><p>The old way was simple: keep it work only, keep it formal. But remote work and the pandemic have blurred those lines. Now there’s more room to be yourself. Some of that might be a casual tone, a funny anecdote, or even memes.</p><ul><li><p>Virtual meetings made home life visible, and suddenly it was normal to see kids or pets in the background.</p></li><li><p>Users started to share more about their daily routines, not just their job titles or achievements.</p></li><li><p>Feedback shifted—the community is less about bragging, and more about encouraging learning and growth.</p></li></ul><p>This new etiquette is less about appearing perfect and more about showing that everyone is learning as they go, especially with all the changes in the job market and workplace tools.</p><h3>Pandemic Effects on LinkedIn Conversations</h3><p>When everyone started working from home, LinkedIn posts started getting more personal very quickly. People shared their <em>anxiety</em> about layoffs, their creative work-from-home setups, and even their struggles with balancing life and work. You can see some of these effects in the numbers below:</p><table style="min-width: 75px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Year</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Content Shared (%)</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Content Viewed (%)</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>2021-2023</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>+42%</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>+27%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p>The line between work and home has faded so much that what counts as "professional" just isn’t as clear-cut as before. It’s like LinkedIn, with its 21,507 employees in over 36 countries (operates internationally), has become a new space for community, not just connections.</p></blockquote><p>These shifts are shaping what people expect out of LinkedIn, whether you’re a jobseeker, a leader, or someone just starting to build a network. The next time you post, don’t be surprised if you feel more comfortable showing some personality. Odds are, your audience expects a little more realness now—and that looks different for everybody.</p><h2>Content Creator Dilemmas in a Knowledge-Driven Feed</h2><img src="https://contenu.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/journalist/643f7b88-3da3-4d81-bdc4-1b2a17171e11/thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Professional confused by merging LinkedIn and Facebook logos"><h3>The Challenge for Indie Voices</h3><p>Creating content on LinkedIn feels different than ever, especially if you’re not connected to a massive company or big industry network. <strong>Indie creators often find themselves squeezed out by a feed that now prefers posts grounded in expertise and actual career knowledge.</strong> It’s not just about sharing cool stories – you have to show <em>real</em> subject know-how. Sometimes it feels like shouting into the wind, hoping someone beyond your usual contacts notices you. Getting traction isn’t as simple as hitting publish and waiting for the algorithm to do the rest.</p><p><strong>Some common struggles for indie creators:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Competing with established industry voices who already have big followings</p></li><li><p>Seeing posts underperform if they don’t match LinkedIn’s new focus on business value</p></li><li><p>Figuring out which part of your knowledge is actually in demand</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Indie creators now have to work twice as hard for half the attention, all while trying not to sound like a walking résumé.</p></blockquote><h3>Algorithmic Gatekeeping</h3><p>So, here’s the not-so-secret part: the LinkedIn algorithm has gotten picky. It checks not only <em>what</em> you’re saying but also whether you’re really the right person to talk about it. If you’re off-topic or lacking credentials, your post isn’t going anywhere outside your friend circle. Even when you do have strong ideas, the algorithm sorts them before they ever reach a wide audience.</p><p><strong>How the algorithm filters content:</strong></p><table style="min-width: 50px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Factor</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Effect on Post Reach</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Subject Match</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>High relevance, more reach</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Author Authority</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Boost if profile matches topic</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Engagement Quality</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Meaningful comments help</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Random Virality</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Almost always filtered out</p></td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><p>If you try to post outside your core area, your reach will be limited.</p></li><li><p>Genuine knowledge, not vague motivation, is prioritized.</p></li><li><p>Quick-burst viral trends? Pretty much ignored or suppressed.</p></li></ul><h3>Building Reputation Through Linktopics</h3><p>There’s a new unspoken rule: <strong>Stick to what you know – and what LinkedIn knows you for.</strong> On this platform, your reputation is glued to your "linktopics," which are the focus areas you repeatedly talk about and build expertise in.</p><ul><li><p>Consistency is key: posting off-topic just muddies your reputation</p></li><li><p>Building up a profile of professional authority means staying in your zone</p></li><li><p>Over time, staying focused on your topics can slowly boost your visibility, but switching fields or interests too much can reset your progress</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>It’s a long game. Instead of chasing quick engagement, creators should pick their lane, build slowly, and accept that reach might be limited – at least at first. The trade-off? More credibility, but less instant applause.</p></blockquote><h2>LinkedIn’s Unique Position Among Social Platforms</h2><p>LinkedIn has always had a different vibe from platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and lately, that gap is only getting wider. <strong>Unlike Facebook, where personal updates and viral trends are king, LinkedIn is doubling down on professional conversations.</strong> That means less "look at my vacation" or "funny meme" content, and more posts about industry news, personal career growth, and practical advice. Twitter, for all its speed and wit, encourages quick takes and debates, but it’s not really built for long-term professional networking or showing off your work history.</p><table style="min-width: 100px;"><colgroup><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"><col style="min-width: 25px;"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Platform</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Focus Area</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Content Style</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Audience</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>LinkedIn</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Professional networking</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Knowledge-based</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Professionals, Businesses</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Facebook</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Personal connections</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Viral/social/visual</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Friends, Family, Wide Public</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Twitter</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Real-time conversation/news</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Short-form, trending</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Broad Public</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You’ll find stories of LinkedIn’s shift everywhere — from users tired of "office party" humblebrags to indie creators struggling with the platform’s changing rules.

The boundaries are clearer: when you want to share career wins or industry insights, LinkedIn is the spot. <em>And if you want to argue about cats or movies, you can take that to the other networks.</em></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, is LinkedIn just turning into another Facebook? Not really. Sure, there was a time when your feed was full of personal stories, selfies, and the kind of posts you’d expect to see on other social networks. But LinkedIn has made it clear: it wants to be different. The focus now is on sharing things that actually help people do better at work, not just posts that rack up likes. That means less viral fluff and more useful advice, tips, and real talk about jobs and careers. People are still showing their human side, but it’s mixed with knowledge that matters. If you’re thinking about what to post, just remember—LinkedIn isn’t about going viral anymore. It’s about connecting with the right people and sharing something that might actually help them out. That’s the new normal, and honestly, it feels like a better fit for what LinkedIn was meant to be in the first place.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Why is LinkedIn moving away from viral posts?</h3><p>LinkedIn wants to focus more on sharing helpful and useful information instead of posts that just get a lot of likes or go viral. They believe that posts should help people learn and grow in their jobs, not just be popular for a short time.</p><h3>What kind of content does LinkedIn want to promote now?</h3><p>LinkedIn is promoting 'knowledge-first' content. This means they want posts that teach something, share job tips, or give advice that helps people in their careers. They are not interested in clickbait or self-promotional stories.</p><h3>Is it okay to share personal stories on LinkedIn?</h3><p>Yes, but there should be a balance. LinkedIn says it’s good to show some personality and share real experiences, but the main focus should still be on work and learning. Oversharing personal details can make people uncomfortable or seem unprofessional.</p><h3>How does LinkedIn decide who sees my posts?</h3><p>LinkedIn uses an algorithm that tries to show your posts to people who will find them most useful. It looks at what topics you usually talk about and your skills, so your posts go to the right audience, not just everyone.</p><h3>Can anyone go viral on LinkedIn now?</h3><p>It’s much harder than before. LinkedIn has changed its system so that posts don’t go viral easily. They want to stop people from trying to 'game' the system just to get lots of views or likes. Quality and relevance are more important than popularity.</p><h3>How is LinkedIn different from Facebook or Twitter now?</h3><p>LinkedIn is focusing on being a professional space where people share knowledge about work and careers. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, which often have lots of personal updates or viral trends, LinkedIn wants to be the place for learning and career growth.</p>
