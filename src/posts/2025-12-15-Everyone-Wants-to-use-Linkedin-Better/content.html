  <h1>Use LinkedIn Better Without Wasting Time</h1>
  <p>You can turn LinkedIn into a productivity engine with just a few intentional habits and a cleaner feed.</p>

  <h2>Why LinkedIn Feels Overwhelming</h2>
  <p>LinkedIn is full of opportunity — but also full of noise. Many professionals love the platform’s potential yet hate how inefficient it feels. Between a <strong>feed full of liked posts</strong>, Suggested Posts, ads and irrelevant recommendations, it’s easy to waste 20–30 minutes before seeing anything meaningful.</p>
  <p>The problem isn’t LinkedIn itself. It’s how unstructured most people’s usage is.</p>

  <p>If you want a deeper breakdown of why your feed behaves this way, see  
    <a href="/blog/why-your-linkedin-feed-feels-messy">why your LinkedIn feed feels messy</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Real Issue Isn’t the Platform — It’s the System</h2>
  <p>Without clear goals and filters, LinkedIn becomes reactive instead of strategic. The algorithm optimizes for engagement, not relevance. That’s why you see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>LinkedIn remove liked posts? Not natively.</li>
    <li>Ads disguised as organic updates.</li>
    <li>Suggested posts from industries you don’t follow.</li>
    <li>Recommendations that have nothing to do with your goals.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is classic <strong>LinkedIn feed clutter</strong> — and it drains your time instead of compounding your visibility.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How to Make LinkedIn Work in Less Time</h2>
  <p>LinkedIn becomes dramatically more useful when you limit your time and increase your intention. Treat it like a daily professional ritual, not a scrolling app. A short routine is often enough to stay visible, informed and connected.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A Simple 10-Minute Daily Routine</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Minute 1–2:</strong> Check notifications and reply only to meaningful interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Minute 3–4:</strong> Scan your curated feed for real insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Minute 5–7:</strong> Leave two thoughtful comments for people you want to stay top-of-mind with.</li>
    <li><strong>Minute 8–10:</strong> Send a follow-up or message to someone you’ve interacted with recently.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This routine compounds into stronger visibility without requiring endless scrolling.</p>
