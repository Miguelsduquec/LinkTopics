  <h1>Look more professional on LinkedIn</h1>
  <p>Looking professional on LinkedIn isn't about perfection — it’s about small habits you repeat consistently.</p>
  <p>Here are seven simple behaviours that instantly upgrade how people perceive you on the platform.</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>1. Keep your headline clear and specific</h2>
  <p>Vague titles like “Consultant” don’t help anyone understand what you do. A professional headline tells people <em>who you help</em> and <em>how you help them</em>. It also improves search visibility inside LinkedIn.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/linkedin-headline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example headline guidelines →</a></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Show up consistently (but not constantly)</h2>
  <p>You don’t need to post daily. But posting 1–3 times per week, plus thoughtful comments, signals reliability and expertise.</p>

  <p>For deeper consistency ideas, see:  
    <a href="/blog/how-to-use-linkedin-without-burning-out-in-2025">How to use LinkedIn without burning out</a>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Comment with insight, not “Great post!”</h2>
  <p>Your comments are mini samples of your thinking. Use them to add perspective, share examples or ask smart questions. This builds your reputation faster than posting more content.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Curate what you see</h2>
  <p>A professional presence starts with what you consume. Unfollow low-value accounts and follow people who consistently add insight.</p>

  <p>To go further, you can use <strong>LinkTopics</strong> to automatically filter out ads, Suggested Posts and “Liked by” clutter — helping your feed reflect the professional image you want to project.</p>

<section>
  <h2>5. Reply to relevant messages in a timely way</h2>
  <p>You don’t need to respond to every pitch, but leaving genuine opportunities unanswered for weeks looks unprofessional. Even a short reply like “Thanks — not the right timing” is better than silence.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Keep your Featured section updated</h2>
  <p>Your Featured section is your portfolio. Add your strongest posts, case studies, landing pages or public talks — the things that best represent your current work, not your past.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Avoid emotional posting</h2>
  <p>Personal reflections are fine. But emotional rants or reactive posts can quickly damage your professional image. A good rule: if you wouldn’t want it on a slide in a future interview, don’t post it.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Professional habits compound over time. Choose one or two from this list, apply them consistently for a month, and you’ll immediately notice the difference in how you’re perceived on LinkedIn.</p>
